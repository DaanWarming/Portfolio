                        we have made some breakthroughs in new directions. We
                        have also done a lot of things in corporate social
                        responsibility (CSR), including fighting against the
                        pandemic, so this is the inaugural year of our global
                        CSR efforts. We hope that in the new year, we can
                        continue to refine our business and continue to consider
                        social responsibility as one of our business goals to

                        Last year was a very special year, with various
                        emergencies, including the novel coronavirus pandemic.
                        The resulting chain reaction was very volatile, and I
                        believe we all felt it. Many people like to say that
                        “quiet years are good years” (岁月静好), but in my
                        opinion, the world is dynamically changing at an
                        accelerated pace. We can see a lot of news every day,
                        and it is very noisy.

                        Therefore, I would like to talk about the topic of
                        "ordinary mind" today. In the face of a dynamically
                        changing world, we are often anxious, worried about the
                        future or upset about the past, and a lot of energy and
                        time are wasted on facing volatilities. In the past,
                        there were more discussions on methodology in the
                        industry, and we all attached great importance to it.
                        But I think that in such an environment, keeping an
                        ordinary mind is something that sounds simple but
                        important.

                        I think people who keep an ordinary mind are more
                        relaxed, have no internal distortions, observe things
                        with a more nuanced perspective, are practical, and have
                        more patience. They tend to get things done better. Most
                        of the time, people are able to have good judgment
                        without paranoia or distractions. There is a saying,
                        “本自具足”, which means “it has always been complete and
                        sufficient, and lacked nothing”. The theme of our
                        anniversary this year is "Remain Grounded, Keep Aiming
                        Higher". My understanding is that these two sentences
                        are similar in meaning. Only when the mind is smoother
                        and more stable, can it be more firmly rooted, and only
                        then can it have the courage and imagination to do
                        things that are more difficult to reach.

                        The word "ordinary mind" is a word of Buddhist origin,
                        and there are many such words in Chinese, such as "精进”
                        (dedicating oneself to refinement or progress) and
                        "想入非非” (daydreaming). The definition of "ordinary
                        mind" in the encyclopedia is: "to remain unbiased and
                        not paranoid under all circumstances and in all
                        actions". In modern psychology, there are also some
                        explanations that basically mean, "doing one's best,
                        going with the flow, and staying calm". If you search
                        the headlines, you can also find other articles,
                        concepts and explanations, such as let it be or let it
                        go, common sense, intuition, and righteousness and
                        sincerity. For example, the saying
                        "不离日用常行内，直到先天未画时” (the supreme principle
                        is buried in one’s mind) is actually about intuition (or
                        intuitive conscience). In the Internet tech circle,
                        there is also the popular saying, "return to the basics,
                        seek truth through facts" and acceptance of uncertainty.

                        most basic thing is to realize that everyone, including

                        Some media want to add drama when they report on
                        startups and people's stories, either by making the
                        experience seem legendary or by dramatizing people’s
                        characters. When I used to be interviewed, people also
                        wanted me to share twists and turns. I often said it was
                        nothing special. In fact, most things, in my opinion,
                        have reasons and justifications. Nothing is particularly
                        that difficult or unusual to explain.

                        It’s really true. As our business has grown, I have
                        gotten to know more and more people, including many very
                        special and capable people. One of my own feelings is:
                        maybe there are some differences in knowledge and
                        experience, but from a “human” point of view, we are
                        still very similar to one another -- we are all ordinary

                      All negativity is caused by an accumulation of

                      Unease, anxiety, tension, stress, worry, all forms of fear

                        This description may sound serious. I would like to give
                        a small example from my own life. I am not particularly
                        disciplined in my life: I often look at my phone, listen
                        to music, read Toutiao, and browse through Douyin and
                        Xigua -- very different from how the outside media
                        portrays me.

                        Sometimes at night, I would plan to do some work, but
                        then get distracted by interesting content on Xigua and
                        browse for a long time. Before going to bed, I would get
                        a little pissed because the things that I planned on
                        finishing are still undone. I would then do some work,
                        but almost as a form of revenge, but that leads to
                        staying up very late (I truly think sleep is very
                        important). The next day, I would go to important
                        meetings, feeling really tired. During these times, what
                        you should actually do is rest. Now, I still don't have
                        a plan to fix this problem, but at least I don't get
                        upset when it happens any more.{" "}

                        focuses on the fact that people spend too much time
                        worrying about the future and obsessing about the past,
                        but very rarely focus on the present, on what should be
                        done, how they feel, and their judgment at the moment.
                        When we say that the past year was a year of dynamic
                        acceleration, many people have many different worries.
                        Perhaps while people are worrying, time and energy have
                        been spent, but there is a lack of attention to more
                        important things happening in the present. Or perhaps in
                        feeling frustrated by the losses and mistakes made in
                        the past, we miss new opportunities.

                        Last year, when we faced challenges and crises, I always
                        told everyone to "stay calm, be patient". And overall,
                        we did that. This is really the biggest gain from our
                        past challenges: you can't control the outcome 100% of
                        the time, so stay calm as much as possible, make the
                        right decisions, don't rush to make decisions, don't
                        panic, and oftentimes you can achieve the best results
                        this way.

                        Of course, we hope that we can grow at a high rate, but
                        you should not let “growth anxiety” affect you. Now the
                        company's business growth is indeed very strong, but we
                        can't indulge in past achievements, nor can we linger on
                        past mistakes. At the same time, we can't have the
                        inertial expectation that our company will definitely
                        become...something! Keep your eyes open to see your
                        environment clearly, understand your users, make good
                        decisions without distractions, and the results will be
                        what they are.

                        There is a saying that if you treat yourself as an
                        object, you can have a more ordinary state of mind. The
                        same is true for a company. Now there are many external
                        summaries of our company -- I think it's called
                        "ByteDance Successology" (字节成功学) -- that are very
                        problematic. I try not to read them. We should not be
                        defined and influenced by external evaluations, but
                        should set a higher standard for ourselves.

                      Quarantines and lock downs forced people indoors and onto
                      social media. That means that everyone’s own emotions
                      became the most important thing in their world. Suddenly,
                      everyone is in the daily habit of an unhealthy and
                      irrational solipsism. Not because we wanted to be, or
                      would be under other circumstances, but because we are all
                      being conditioned to be introverted and
                      consumption-obsessed egomaniacs.

                      Relative timestamps make everything feel immediate and
                      time-sensitive. This is necessary for social media
                      companies because otherwise these textual interactions can
                      feel asynchronous. That’s the perk of email; You can
                      respond whenever you want. Without relative time stamps,
                      social media would feel just a bit more like an old-style
                      internet forum or BBS, and less like an instant messaging
                      service. This minuscule feature change has a massive
                      impact: it subconsciously increases FOMO (Fear Of Missing
                      Out), which encourages longer and more frequent use
                      patterns at the direct mental expense of the user.

                      Infinite scrolling is also problematic because it makes
                      users stick around longer. If the app allows for scrolling
                      down forever and never stops or interrupts, this means
                      that any user can now scroll compulsively, half paying
                      attention, without being interrupted, indefinitely. The
                      result is that users unthinkingly keep themselves glued to
                      their forever-feeds for a much longer period of time,
                      which increases profit for the company running the app.
                      Again, this is all subconscious. The user has no idea that
                      they are being drawn in to addictive use patterns to
                      improve the profits of Big Tech.

                      Most alarming is the “internet points”. On Reddit, this is
                      called Karma. On Twitter, it’s likes and retweets.
                      Ostensibly, this simple numeric score displays the
                      community’s overall attitude toward a given piece of
                      content. On its face, this appears to be a radically
                      democratic concept; Everyone can vote! The reality is very
                      different. Reddit, for example, has always obfuscated the
                      true Karma score (“to prevent vote brigading”), and the
                      position of a piece of content within the feed can be
                      purposely decided by the Reddit home office, not by the
                      community. This is incredibly, deeply sinister.

                      The most addictive part of social media is the chemical
                      addiction. When you can click an animated icon to show
                      your appreciation for or reaction to a piece of content,
                      it gives you a shot of dopamine. It adds value to the
                      interaction, and it makes the user feel empowered.
                      Likewise, if you get a lot of reactions to your content,
                      you get rewarded by your own brain. This leads to, quite
                      literally,{" "}

                      Reddit has created an app that supports a community such
                      that it appears to be democratic in its general
                      functioning, but is actually very specifically curated
                      toward a preferred set of political and social ends. It
                      fosters a feeling of being an outsider in anyone who dares
                      to disagree with what “everyone” purportedly already
                      believes. This makes it incredibly easy to fall into
                      irrational rage fits over “the other,” or what one
                      imagines them to be, and to allow one’s political and
                      social views to slip ever more deeply toward extremism,
                      destructiveness, and the worst of the mob mentality.
                      “Everyone already believes X,” the user says to herself,
                      “why in the world don’t I? What’s wrong with me?” And
                      thus, the user is gaslit out of her own principles, and
                      conditioned to follow the herd without question. Who
                      doesn’t want to fit in and be seen as “normal”?

                      Reddit has only developed into this Great Beast With Seven
                      Heads And Ten Horns fairly recently. Facebook has actually
                      been doing this exact psychological manipulation tactic
                      for years. They tell you that your friends all think a
                      certain way already, and that leads you to believe that
                      you are the odd one out for having your own opinions. They
                      even infamously tell users on occasion that their friends
                      are “liking” the Facebook pages of big-name sponsors. Some
                      users noticed this when they saw that their deceased
                      relatives had “liked” an advertisement’s Facebook page.
                      How much more evil can you get?

                      nerd that I absolutely am, this reminds me of an episode
                      of Star Trek: The Next Generation. Commander Riker happens
                      upon a “game” which is actually an extremely efficient
                      dopamine delivery device. Basically, placing this device
                      on your head (
                    </span>
                    <span>

                    <span>
                      ) makes you feel like you’re getting a shot of straight
                      dopamine, or morphine, or some pleasurable brain-drug, and
                      it’s incredibly addictive. So addictive that it causes
                      problems across the whole crew. To me, that’s the episode
                      that tried to warn us about social media. We should have
                      listened.

                      . It will be the great beast of global technocracy, and
                      Big Brother will not be a government. To the contrary, the
                      Ministries of Truth, Peace, Love, and Plenty will all be
                      private (or publicly traded) entities. In this way, no
                      Constitution, or Magna Carta, or any other foundational
                      document designed to keep government tyranny at bay will
                      be able to operate as intended. It won’t be “the
                      government” depriving us of our rights. It will be private
                      companies with their own verbose and opaquely worded Terms
                      of Service, and wide-ranging End User License Agreements.
                      Right now, we can get by without Twitter or Reddit or
                      Facebook if we really have to (and many of us do quite
                      happily). Soon, you will not be able to opt out of the
                      technocratic dictatorship that we are all to be subject
                      to.

                      The reason we had to start off with step 1 was that it was
                      all I could afford to do with what I made from PayPal. I
                      thought our chances of success were so low that I didn't
                      want to risk anyone's funds in the beginning but my own.
                      The list of successful car company startups is short. As
                      of 2016, the number of American car companies that haven't
                      gone bankrupt is a grand total of two: Ford and Tesla.
                      Starting a car company is idiotic and an electric car
                      company is idiocy squared.

                      Also, a low volume car means a much smaller, simpler
                      factory, albeit with most things done by hand. Without
                      economies of scale, anything we built would be expensive,
                      whether it was an economy sedan or a sports car. While at
                      least some people would be prepared to pay a high price
                      for a sports car, no one was going to pay $100k for an
                      electric Honda Civic, no matter how cool it looked.

                      Part of the reason I wrote the first master plan was to
                      defend against the inevitable attacks Tesla would face
                      accusing us of just caring about making cars for rich
                      people, implying that we felt there was a shortage of
                      sports car companies or some other bizarre rationale.
                      Unfortunately, the blog didn't stop countless attack
                      articles on exactly these grounds, so it pretty much
                      completely failed that objective.

                      However, the main reason was to explain how our actions
                      fit into a larger picture, so that they would seem less
                      random. The point of all this was, and remains,
                      accelerating the advent of sustainable energy, so that we
                      can imagine far into the future and life is still good.
                      That's what "sustainable" means. It's not some silly,
                      hippy thing -- it matters for everyone.

                      By definition, we must at some point achieve a sustainable
                      energy economy or we will run out of fossil fuels to burn
                      and civilization will collapse. Given that we must get off

                      We can't do this well if Tesla and SolarCity are different
                      companies, which is why we need to combine and break down
                      the barriers inherent to being separate companies. That
                      they are separate at all, despite similar origins and
                      pursuit of the same overarching goal of sustainable
                      energy, is largely an accident of history. Now that Tesla
                      is ready to scale Powerwall and SolarCity is ready to
                      provide highly differentiated solar, the time has come to
                      bring them together.

                      Today, Tesla addresses two relatively small segments of
                      premium sedans and SUVs. With the Model 3, a future
                      compact SUV and a new kind of pickup truck, we plan to
                      address most of the consumer market. A lower cost vehicle
                      than the Model 3 is unlikely to be necessary, because of
                      the third part of the plan described below.

                      What really matters to accelerate a sustainable future is
                      being able to scale up production volume as quickly as
                      possible. That is why Tesla engineering has transitioned
                      to focus heavily on designing the machine that makes the
                      machine -- turning the factory{" "}

                      into a product. A first principles physics analysis of
                      automotive production suggests that somewhere between a 5
                      to 10 fold improvement is achievable by version 3 on a
                      roughly 2 year iteration cycle. The first Model 3 factory
                      machine should be thought of as version 0.5, with version
                      1.0 probably in 2018.

                      In addition to consumer vehicles, there are two other
                      types of electric vehicle needed: heavy-duty trucks and
                      high passenger-density urban transport. Both are in the
                      early stages of development at Tesla and should be ready
                      for unveiling next year. We believe the Tesla Semi will
                      deliver a substantial reduction in the cost of cargo
                      transport, while increasing safety and making it really
                      fun to operate.

                      With the advent of autonomy, it will probably make sense
                      to shrink the size of buses and transition the role of bus
                      driver to that of fleet manager. Traffic congestion would
                      improve due to increased passenger areal density by
                      eliminating the center aisle and putting seats where there
                      are currently entryways, and matching acceleration and
                      braking to other vehicles, thus avoiding the inertial
                      impedance to smooth traffic flow of traditional heavy
                      buses. It would also take people all the way to their
                      destination. Fixed summon buttons at existing bus stops
                      would serve those who don't have a phone. Design
                      accommodates wheelchairs, strollers and bikes.

                      As the technology matures, all Tesla vehicles will have
                      the hardware necessary to be fully self-driving with
                      fail-operational capability, meaning that any given system
                      in the car could break and your car will still drive
                      itself safely. It is important to emphasize that
                      refinement and validation of the software will take much
                      longer than putting in place the cameras, radar, sonar and
                      computing hardware.

                      Even once the software is highly refined and far better
                      than the average human driver, there will still be a
                      significant time gap, varying widely by jurisdiction,
                      before true self-driving is approved by regulators. We
                      expect that worldwide regulatory approval will require
                      something on the order of 6 billion miles (10 billion km).
                      Current fleet learning is happening at just over 3 million
                      miles (5 million km) per day.

                      I should add a note here to explain why Tesla is deploying
                      partial autonomy now, rather than waiting until some point
                      in the future. The most important reason is that, when
                      used correctly, it is already significantly safer than a
                      person driving by themselves and it would therefore be
                      morally reprehensible to delay release simply for fear of
                      bad press or some mercantile calculation of legal
                      liability.

                      According to the recently released 2015 NHTSA report,
                      automotive fatalities increased by 8% to one death every
                      89 million miles. Autopilot miles will soon exceed twice
                      that number and the system gets better every day. It would
                      no more make sense to disable Tesla's Autopilot, as some
                      have called for, than it would to disable autopilot in
                      aircraft, after which our system is named.

                      It is also important to explain why we refer to Autopilot
                      as "beta". This is not beta software in any normal sense
                      of the word. Every release goes through extensive internal
                      validation before it reaches any customers. It is called
                      beta in order to decrease complacency and indicate that it
                      will continue to improve (Autopilot is always off by
                      default). Once we get to the point where Autopilot is
                      approximately 10 times safer than the US vehicle average,
                      the beta label will be removed.

                      You will also be able to add your car to the Tesla shared
                      fleet just by tapping a button on the Tesla phone app and
                      have it generate income for you while you're at work or on
                      vacation, significantly offsetting and at times
                      potentially exceeding the monthly loan or lease cost. This
                      dramatically lowers the true cost of ownership to the
                      point where almost anyone could own a Tesla. Since most
                      cars are only in use by their owner for 5% to 10% of the
                      day, the fundamental economic utility of a true
                      self-driving car is likely to be several times that of a
                      car which is not.

                      Most very powerful items in the game are soulbound, and
                      typically require completing a complicated quest or
                      killing a very powerful monster, usually with the help of
                      anywhere from four to thirty nine other players. Hence, in
                      order to get your character anywhere close to having the
                      best weapons and armor, you have no choice but to
                      participate in killing some of these extremely difficult
                      monsters yourself.

                      The purpose of the mechanic is fairly clear: it keeps the
                      game challenging and interesting, by making sure that to
                      get the best items you have to actually go and do the hard
                      thing and figure out how to kill the dragon. You can't
                      just go kill boars ten hours a day for a year, get
                      thousands of gold, and buy the epic magic armor from other
                      players who killed the dragon for you.

                      Of course, the system is very imperfect: you could just
                      pay a team of professionals to kill the dragon with you
                      and let you collect the loot, or even outright buy a
                      character on a secondary market, and do this all with
                      out-of-game US dollars so you don't even have to kill
                      boars. But even still, it makes for a much better game
                      than every item always having a price.

                      But what exactly are these NFTs signaling? Certainly, one
                      part of the answer is some kind of skill in acquiring NFTs
                      and knowing which NFTs to acquire. But because NFTs are
                      tradeable items, another big part of the answer inevitably
                      becomes that NFTs are about signaling wealth.

                      If someone shows you that they have an NFT that is
                      obtainable by doing X, you can't tell whether they did X
                      themselves or whether they just paid someone else to do X.
                      Some of the time this is not a problem: for an NFT
                      supporting a charity, someone buying it off the secondary
                      market is sacrificing their own funds for the cause and
                      they are helping the charity by contributing to others'
                      incentive to buy the NFT, and so there is no reason to
                      discriminate against them. And indeed, a lot of good can
                      come from charity NFTs alone. But what if we want to
                      create NFTs that are not just about who has the most
                      money, and that actually try to signal something else?

                      POAP is an excellent example of an NFT that works better
                      if it could be soulbound. If someone is looking at your

                      on-chain face a similar problem: they would be much less
                      valuable if someone who doesn't meet the condition
                      themselves could just go buy one from someone who does.

                      POAP has made the technical decision to not block
                      transferability of the POAPs themselves. There are good
                      reasons for this: users might have a good reason to want
                      to migrate all their assets from one wallet to another
                      (eg. for security), and the security of
                      non-transferability implemented "naively" is not very
                      strong anyway because users could just create a wrapper
                      account that holds the NFT and then sell the ownership of
                      that.

                      To solve this problem, the POAP team is suggesting that
                      developers who care about non-transferability implement
                      checks on their own: they could check on-chain if the
                      current owner is the same address as the original owner,
                      and they could add more sophisticated checks over time if
                      deemed necessary. This is, for now, a more future-proof
                      approach.

                      Can we limit transferability without going all the way and
                      basing everything on proof of humanity? It becomes harder,
                      but there are medium-strength approaches that are probably
                      good enough for some use cases. Making an NFT bound to an
                      ENS name is one simple option, if we assume that users
                      care enough about their ENS names that they are not
                      willing to transfer them. For now, what we're likely to
                      see is a spectrum of approaches to limit transferability,
                      with different projects choosing different tradeoffs
                      between security and convenience.

                      where you cannot just move them into a fresh account or
                      even a smart contract? If proof of huamnity starts getting

                      Transfers could be done on-chain; the simplest technique
                      may just be a transaction that calls a factory contract to
                      make the old item invalid and the new item valid, using a
                      ZK-SNARK to prove that the operation is valid.

                      Privacy is an important part of making this kind of
                      ecosystem work well. In some cases, the underlying thing
                      that the item is representing is already public, and so
                      there is no point in trying to add privacy. But in many
                      other cases, users would not want to reveal everything
                      that they have. If, one day in the future, being
                      vaccinated becomes a POAP, one of the worst things we
                      could do would be to create a system where the POAP is
                      automatically advertised for everyone to see and everyone
                      has no choice but to let their medical decision be
                      influenced by what would look cool in their particular
                      social circle. Privacy being a core part of the design can
                      avoid these bad outcomes and increase the chance that we
                      create something great.

                      However, there are technical challenges to doing this, and
                      an uneasy "interface" between the desire to limit or
                      prevent transfers and a blockchain ecosystem where so far
                      all of the standards are designed around maximum
                      transferability. Attaching items to "identity objects"
                      that users are either unable (as with proof-of-humanity
                      profiles) or unwilling (as with ENS names) to trade away
                      seems like the most promising path, but challenges remain
                      in making this easy-to-use, private and secure. We need
                      more effort on thinking through and solving these
                      challenges. If we can, this opens a much wider door to
                      blockchains being at the center of ecosystems that are
                      collaborative and fun, and not just about money.

                      Mental models are frameworks for thinking. They simplify
                      complex situations so you can reason through them easily.
                      They help you make good, long-term decisions without
                      needing to know everything about a situation.

                      The SpaceX team looked past decades of incremental rocket
                      improvements to re-examine spaceflight from scratch. They
                      asked, What do the underlying engineering (not historical)
                      principles reveal to be the most cost-efficient and
                      power-efficient way to build a rocket? They worked up from
                      those physical realities to build the world’s most

                      The job market is itself a cog in another machine: earning
                      financial stability. But what if you could achieve
                      financial stability without having to toil away at a 9 to
                      5? If your real passion lies outside of the office, then
                      climbing the corporate ladder would be falling prey to
                      inertia. Instead, the better path would be reducing your
                      expenses by moving to a cheaper city and living more
                      modestly. With lower costs, you could switch to part-time
                      and pursue your passions.

                      This is a hard question to ask due to the phenomenon of
                      inertia. Using a mental model to break out of your flow
                      and question what you’re doing is like ripping the carpet
                      out from under your goals. It’s painful to confront the
                      possibility that you’ve spent years on the wrong thing.
                      Whether it’s coding, a 9-5, saving money, building
                      muscle—anything—you’ve been riding the momentum of steady
                      progress.

                      What people don't realize is that working hard without

                      hidden form of laziness. Yes, appreciate the beauty of

                      It's the clearest sign you’ve abandoned mental models,
                      because the use of models continually adjusts your life
                      trajectory. This is what I meant earlier when I said:
                      "Accomplished people regularly reassess their priorities
                      without fear of changing them. They don't fall prey to
                      inertia."

                      Think of it like this: mental models are powered by
                      information. They produce different recommendations based
                      on the updated information you put into them. So, if
                      you're in a flow state for a long time, you'll have buried
                      your head without ingesting new data, advice, articles,
                      and so on. Your mental model will no longer be a
                      functioning compass for what to do next.

                      A classic example is how teenagers are told to go to
                      college. They enter a flow state in pursuit of college but
                      at no point do they question themselves out of it: Should
                      you really be going to school for the degree you chose? Or
                      did you choose the degree because “it felt right" when you
                      were 17 and you haven’t re-examined the decision since?
                      Could you make a convincing argument for why all the other
                      degrees would not be better options? If you can’t make
                      that argument convincingly, you’re not thinking
                      critically. Once they get to college, they're in a flow
                      state of trying to graduate. They play a low-level game of
                      securing a high GPA instead of a higher-level game of
                      learning useful skills that prepare them for the job
                      market.

                      comes from the top 20% of your friends. So, preferentially
                      strengthen relationships with those friends and drop many
                      of the rest. Be cognizant of nourishing the friendships
                      that actually matter.

                      Another example: 80% of your procrastination comes from
                      20% of your indulgences. So, place those 2-4 top
                      indulgences out of arm’s reach, and you’ll see an outsized
                      gain in weekly output. The implication is that you don’t
                      have to completely isolate yourself from distractions.
                      That would be inefficient and impractical. Just do the
                      80/20.

                      painful process. It's a rush. Similarly, the smartest

                      Mental models are critical for living wisely. Yet, somehow
                      they're not even a blip on our educational radar.

                      School failed you. But you no longer have that excuse. You
                      now understand the significance of mental models. The onus
                      is on you to cultivate the discipline to use them.

                      Here's what I recommend: Schedule a recurring event in
                      your calendar. Every second Friday, block out 20 minutes
                      to step back from your life and run all your systems and
                      decisions through the mental models listed above.

                      to make Facebook Marketplace work, when so many local

                      I pitched the idea for Facebook Marketplace in 2009, when
                      Sheryl Sandberg interviewed me for a Product Marketing
                      role at Facebook (aka Meta). We didn’t start working on
                      Marketplace until 2015, however. Five years after launch,
                      the Marketplace Tab on Facebook now has over a billion
                      monthly active users, more than Snapchat and Twitter

                      I knew I wanted to build commerce into Facebook from the
                      moment I walked into my first interview. It seemed
                      inevitable that social commerce would be an important part
                      of the company and its products. Social networking was not
                      simply about sharing with friends; in many places,
                      especially in emerging markets, commerce was a core part
                      of the “

                      more than half of people studied in many countries cited
                      Facebook as a place they had bought or sold things. This
                      was less common in Western markets, which made it a blind
                      spot for many of those at the company.

                      Unfortunately, I was terrible at selling the idea, and for
                      five years, nothing happened. We tried hackathons,

                      But I saw something they didn’t. In 2012, I was the only
                      PM who was a mom. I used to joke that because I had three
                      kids, and there were six women PMs, on average we each had
                      half a kid—but I had to go home and take care of all of
                      them. I was a member of multiple mom groups, where people
                      bought and sold all sorts of things. Kids generate a lot
                      of used goods, many of which are insanely expensive to buy
                      new. I also had friends in Asia who talked about how
                      meaningful buying and selling in groups was to them, and
                      how Facebook was{" "}

                      couldn’t. Although the efforts didn’t take for several
                      years, I continued to toy with the idea and brainstorm
                      ways of making it possible.

                      At the time, commerce in groups was informal and
                      completely organic. One of the biggest issues early on was
                      that there was no way to know what groups were meant for
                      selling things (vs. being purely social). We decided to
                      set up a way to allow group admins to opt into becoming
                      classified commerce groups. This allowed us to track
                      organic behaviors on the platform. We found that many more
                      people were part of Facebook Groups communities that had
                      been set up specifically for buying, selling, and trading
                      than we expected. Some were local mini-marketplaces (ex:{" "}

                      structuring the groups so that items for sale showed up as
                      listings rather than just discussion posts. We also
                      started to rank the group content to help people discover
                      products for sale. Prior to this, no group content was
                      ranked—it was purely chronological.

                      We eventually ran into a problem. Being stuck within the
                      Groups system was constraining, and most users had trouble
                      discovering groups, joining them, and finding items. This
                      meant that we faced the twin marketplace issues of limited
                      seller liquidity and difficult buyer discovery. Buyers
                      told us in research studies that they couldn’t find the
                      items they wanted, and sellers felt that their reach was
                      limited. We knew we had to think bigger.

                      Almost every two-sided marketplace struggles with bringing
                      on enough supply and/or bringing on enough demand.
                      Surprisingly, Facebook didn’t. We already had both buyers
                      and sellers, but we weren’t succeeding in making the
                      connection between the two. As long as we stayed within
                      Groups, we could not address this issue. We had two
                      options:

                      We debated for some time and finally decided that having a
                      tab in the largest app in the world was preferable to
                      having a separate app. The ability to work within the
                      Facebook ecosystem, where millions of people were already
                      trading in communities, made this decision a no-brainer.
                      Though we expected to launch a separate app once
                      Marketplace became successful, you will likely notice that
                      it never happened in the years since, because the
                      experience was better integrated into Facebook itself.

                      Launching one of the first new tabs in the app was no
                      small feat. The good news was that Mark [Zuckerberg]
                      wanted to make space for more “jobs to be done” in the app
                      by adding new tabs. He offered the opportunity to our team
                      and the Video team first. As other teams began requesting
                      tabs, including Groups, Pages, and News, the team that
                      managed the navigation within the app had to create rules
                      about how tabs could be used and how the channels could be
                      leveraged. This led to the development of the system of
                      dynamic tabs you see today.

                      We evaluated a number of options for building the V1,
                      balancing speed and functionality, and decided to use
                      React Native, one of the first major products to do so.
                      This enabled us to build nearly twice as fast, at the cost
                      of flexibility. Under Vijaye’s leadership, the coding and
                      launching of our V1 product to several U.S. cities took
                      about two months.

                      Once we had the tab within the Facebook app to drive buyer
                      engagement, we settled on the key metric of{" "}
                    </span>
                    <span>
                      <em>weekly buyer retention</em>
                    </span>
                    <span>
                      . Our early bet was that supply would drive demand—that
                      having sufficient inventory would get buyers excited about
                      coming to this new tab to browse. To do that, we had to
                      get sellers on board. Sellers had no incentive to create
                      new listings on an unknown marketplace with no clear buyer
                      engagement. That led us to make it a “one-checkbox
                      experience,” which allowed sellers to take items that were
                      already being listed in groups and cross-post them into
                      the Marketplace Tab as a way to seed the early supply.

                      Some items were more suited to Groups, such as marbles,
                      which were mostly bought and sold by enthusiasts within
                      their own communities. However, many sellers wanted to
                      drive maximum discovery to move items, especially larger
                      ones, like furniture, cars, and electronics. As we tested
                      cross-posting, we were able to assess the quality and
                      diversity of the inventory that would show up in the new
                      Marketplace Tab well before launch. Typically, we turned
                      on cross-posting within Groups for two months before we
                      rolled out Marketplace in that area.

                      Surprisingly, buyer engagement among weekly active users
                      was relatively high at the start, and it remained so
                      during the testing period. This meant that we were able to
                      keep buyers coming back on a regular basis. Once we had
                      sufficient buyer engagement, we decided to roll out from a
                      few cities to a few states. Before long, we were ready to
                      launch in five countries, which we selected carefully to
                      ensure that we got a sense of the product’s performance in
                      different areas of the world. We were no longer going to
                      be in beta, but were ready to go live on a broad scale.

                      Needless to say, it wasn’t pretty. A small bug in the
                      fraud queues resulted in a massive flood of violating
                      items. We were able to get it cleaned up quickly by
                      reinstating the rules, but it was an inauspicious start,
                      to say the least. But this was the first in many lessons
                      about what could—and did—go wrong on the path to success.

                      Buying and selling face-to-face meant that trust was a
                      huge factor, especially when it came to bulky items that
                      required people to meet up in person. We sold our minivan
                      on Marketplace, and we knew we had to meet with buyers. My
                      husband reviewed the profiles of everyone who messaged him
                      and arranged a meetup with the first two people who
                      reached out. He felt more comfortable seeing their real
                      identities and the duration they had been on the Facebook
                      platform, something that wasn’t possible on other,
                      anonymous platforms. He invited them to meet him near our
                      home to test-drive the vehicle. Within 48 hours, he sold
                      the minivan to a small-business owner, who paid him in
                      cash, and they went to transfer the title together.

                      People use Facebook widely and frequently, often multiple
                      times a day. Adding a local and shipped commerce solution
                      only extended the value of the app and the things that
                      could be done with it. The fact that you can have the app
                      open already and see when something new comes up for sale
                      is part of the serendipitous discovery aspect of
                      Marketplace.

                      Being integrated with Facebook Messenger makes
                      communication fast and easy. It allows you to pin your

                      deposit to someone. This has greatly streamlined the

                      bought my kids two digital cameras from a student I had
                      met at Stanford just the year before. This idea of
                      people-powered commerce, buying from your neighbors, and
                      reducing waste was part of the ethos of the product from
                      the start.

                      From the start, we noticed that some of the most popular
                      items on Marketplace were cars and rentals, which
                      surprised us. We did not realize that there was such
                      demand for these big-ticket items online. We started
                      working on structuring posts so that people could easily
                      list places for rent and cars for sale. This enabled us to
                      double down on these new verticals, which helped us become
                      key players in those markets.

                      Notably, the “job to be done” in these categories was
                      unique to Facebook. Many rentals were for roommate
                      situations or home-sharing, so trust was incredibly
                      important. Knowing someone had mutual friends or had been
                      active on Facebook for over a decade provided confidence
                      to those who were looking for someone to live with. The
                      same goes for car selling: Trust is important, since you
                      are meeting and getting into a car with a stranger. Buying
                      a car is one of the biggest transactions someone does in a
                      year, so taking the anonymity out of the process created a
                      winning category.

                      Immediately upon launch, we also noticed that search
                      numbers were incredibly low. Our Research team showed
                      buyers two test phones: one with Marketplace and one with
                      a different local classifieds service. They then asked
                      them to “find an iPhone to buy.” On Facebook, ‌users
                      immediately started to scroll, whereas on other apps, they
                      searched. This led us to realize that people on Facebook
                      had learned never to use the search bar except when
                      searching for people. We addressed this by putting a large
                      search button next to the search bar, which our designers
                      grudgingly allowed. This changed the trajectory of the
                      search participation rate, and even when we removed the
                      button, searches remained at the new, higher level.

                      While the product started primarily for mobile, we
                      realized that to be competitive, we needed to add a
                      desktop version. This was important for larger purchases
                      and would make listing easier for high-volume sellers.

                      Once we had expanded beyond five countries, we began to
                      notice new issues that hadn’t appeared when we were in
                      testing in just a few states. For example, it was very
                      difficult to distinguish between authentic and inauthentic
                      goods. We ended up having to work with brands and build
                      models to detect violating items. We also needed a more
                      fine-tuned violation reporting flow and a more robust
                      takedown and appeal process. As with any enforcement
                      model, we faced false positives. We needed to scale the
                      tooling to be able to perform a manual review of the
                      sellers and ensure that they were following the rules.

                      We saw different problems arise in different countries,
                      which complicated things. In one country, the issue of
                      selling diplomas (i.e. printed certifications) appeared.
                      This is less of an issue in other countries, so we had to
                      decide what to do with the policy. We had to find a way to
                      keep that particular country safe, such as detecting

                      without adding substantial hurdles in other countries
                      where this was not a problem.

                      The hardest part of offline transactions was knowing when
                      a transaction actually took place. Transaction
                      verification was crucial; it gave us a better
                      understanding of which items sold and which items did not,
                      which helped us improve rankings. To address both
                      violations and transaction measurement, we settled on
                      encouraging buyers and sellers to report transactions by
                      incentivizing ratings and reviews. We noted when buyers
                      and sellers messaged back and forth to get a sense of the
                      ways they interacted. Later, we added online payments and
                      shipping labels with tracking information so that we could
                      see when transactions were completed and items were
                      delivered.

                      Being responsive to challenges while maintaining a core
                      product roadmap required a team that adjusted quickly. We
                      had to stay on top of new issues as they arose but also
                      keep the team innovating and building features that
                      customers expected. This is the constant push-pull of
                      building a product that balances the needs of buyers and
                      sellers while preventing bad actors and negotiating the
                      external environment. Without a team that is able to flex
                      to the right priorities at the right time, this product
                      would never have been successful.

                      Our team often joked that Marketplace was a five-year
                      overnight success. While it seems straightforward on the
                      other side, there were times during that period when we
                      struggled with achieving true product-market fit. In the
                      end, however, we succeeded, and Marketplace is no longer
                      the simple and scrappy product we started in 2015. It is
                      incredibly exciting to see how far it has come, and I look
                      forward to seeing how it continues to evolve.

                      Other times the questions are truly … questions. They come
                      from the moments where we’re genuinely humble, and have
                      arrived at the limits of our knowledge. We’re just
                      thinking out loud, and, ideally, trying to find a really{" "}

                      question, one that frames our ignorance in a productive
                      fashion. Many thinkers — from Socrates to my personal fave
                      literary scholar Northrop Frye — argued that the acme of
                      intellectual life wasn’t in knowing stuff but devising the
                      truly puzzling, awe-inspiring questions that echo in the
                      mind for years.

                      Of course, sometimes questions are sort of fun — jokey
                      ones, where everyone knows the answer (or thinks they do),
                      so the writer is just making a bond with the audience.

                      interestingly, fiction often doesn’t produce interesting
                      results. That’s because dialogue often includes questions,
                      and you get too many of them in a row, so now you’re just
                      reading dialogue. In contrast …

                      directly to the audience, and the questions have a really

                      to explain why this is not the case. Game economies are
                      something which I’ve spent a lot of time with, I used to
                      do game design stuff on Roblox, so seeing all this hype
                      pop up really made me want to figure out what was going on
                      here.

                      Crypto gaming is a relatively new invention in the crypto
                      (web3.0 if you like the marketing rebrand) space.
                      Supporters call it the next iteration of crypto adoption,
                      where they expand the long-held notion in crypto of “self
                      sovereignty” into the realm of gaming too, where all their
                      accumulated in-game currencies and special items
                      (represented as NFTs) sit in their crypto wallets, free
                      for them to monetise at any point by selling them on the
                      open market. The phenomenon of being able to earn in-game
                      currency (similiar to how you can earn small amount of
                      in-game currency in games like Fortnite) but with the
                      ability to sell it for real fiat currency has earned the
                      genre the “Play to Earn” (or P2E) label.

                      Well, first, why do people play games? Because they enjoy
                      it, or if we’re talking in economic terms, they gain
                      utility from it. Kids play Roblox because they want to
                      have fun playing with their customised avatars in
                      user-generated games. Teenagers play Call of Duty Warzone
                      because it’s an inherently *fun* game. The games I’ve just
                      mentioned are free to play, but other very popular games
                      like Grand Theft Auto V, Fifa 21 etc etc do cost money.

                      But P2E turns this idea on its head completely. Crypto
                      gamers aren’t playing these games because they’re fun. In
                      fact, all these games are very underdeveloped and frankly
                      very boring. The reason why players play P2E games is in
                      the damn name:{" "}

                      How it works is pretty simple, and I’ll walk you through
                      the very simplified user flow of the most hyped up and
                      popular blockchain game, Axie Infinity (basically dollar

                      So to breed Axies, one needs to buy SLP + AXS (the
                      governance token for Axie). Therefore, the demand for SLP
                      (what keeps the price propped up) is a function of
                      breeding activity. But that’s not all, there’s also pure
                      speculative demand. The supply mainly comes from the game
                      throwing coins at players, but it also comes from players
                      who are selling their SLPs on the open market. Note that
                      currently the quantity of token inflation far exceeds the
                      amount of SLP being destroyed through the breeding
                      process.

                      The speculative market for SLP, although beneficial in the
                      initial stages to help increase the SLP price, will also
                      accelerate the further downfall of SLP when the market
                      starts to see more players trying to exit to realise their
                      “earnings” and less players willing to enter the game.
                      Reflexivity is a real thing, and it’s going to
                      particularly sting the crypto gaming market for sure.

                      takes a % fee from sales in the NFT marketplace. It seems
                      cruel that people in the Phillipines are being told that
                      playing games is their route to financial freedom.
                      Dragging underprivileged people into “play to earn” games,
                      making them borrow from “guilds” because they can’t afford
                      to front the costs of entering the game themselves in
                      exchange for a large share their “earnings”, which all
                      come from selling their NFTs and SLP tokens to new players
                      who want to do the exact same thing, is not a pathway to

                      Instead of selling in-game items directly for fiat
                      currency, traditional game developers tend to sell in-game
                      items for their own in-game currency, which itself has its
                      price fixed to the dollar. Game developers fix the in-game
                      currency price to USD because they want to be able to
                      monetise their game simply, and a lot of their expenses
                      are denominated in USD! A floating currency means that
                      suddenly a crucial factor which drives the in-game economy
                      becomes uncontrollable/unpredictable, which is not what a
                      developer wants. This is why games like Fortnite, Roblox,

                      Developers also have to make sure they “drip” a small

                      An example guide to designing in-game economies, from the
                      get go you have to have full monetary autonomy (that is
                      how you can increase the quantity of in-game money via
                      rewards) to ensure that you can design the game how you
                      see fit to continue driving sustainable user engagement.
                      This has implications later on for crypto game economies

                      So, I explained all this in-game economy design stuff to
                      an ex FX and interest rate derivatives trader with decades
                      of experience a couple of weeks ago, talking about how
                      Roblox has to implement capital controls to the extent
                      that they make it almost impossible to buy Robux on the
                      secondary market because their entire business model
                      relies on them being the only supplier Robux for fiat
                      currency and they have to keep the price stable because
                      it’s good for both UX and their business.{" "}

                        summarised under the Mundell-Fleming Trilemma, and NOW
                        THIS trilemma is what exposes the fundamental economic

                      for the purchase of in-game items of in-game currency.
                      Users have to keep on buying in-game currency to keep on
                      buying things, at a USD price set by the developer. “Hotel

                      has become ubiquitous across the entire industry precisely
                      because capital controls are the only way a game developer
                      can make money when there is an in-game currency, since by
                      restricting others selling currency on the secondary
                      market, the developer can keep a monopoly on the issuance
                      of the currency, and so it leaves them in the position
                      that every time a player wants to buy the currency they go
                      to the developer directly and pay them real USD in
                      exchange for new in-game currency. It makes the
                      monetisation of the game *sustainable*.

                          effort to restrict secondary market trading of their

                        ). The flawed P2E model inevitably means that developers
                        have to resort to alternative methods to monetise the
                        game, like making the purchase of a certain amount of
                        NFTs compulsory to even start playing the game, and then
                        taking % fee of every NFT transaction. This model is
                        only sustainable as long as there are more and more
                        players entering the game to make money by purchasing
                        the NFTs and then grind out many hours, which they will
                        only do if they can sell all their NFTs and earned
                        tokens to someone else who wants to do the same thing.
                        This really convolutes the basic model of a game for all
                        parties involved.

                      simplify this into a basic macroeconomic scenario. Just
                      like the south of Italy is dependent on tourists coming in
                      and spending money (tourism is an export of course), a
                      game economy is dependent on gamers spending money on
                      goods and services in the game.

                      Roblox is a great example of how to design a game economy
                      (game economies rather, Robux powers all games in the
                      Roblox ecosystem). Not just from a currency perspective
                      (issuing and redeeming Robux at massive spreads, 30%
                      transaction tax to withdraw R$ from circulation, requiring
                      adverts to be paid for in R$ etc). Crypto gaming bros
                      think they’re onto something new here, but the truth is,
                      Roblox has tried and implemented these concepts before, to
                      various levels of failure and success.

                      currency that was rewarded for participation. Tix could be
                      used for user ads , something which now costs real money
                      with Robux, so they were effectively giving out free
                      utility. But it came with a problem, there was a lot of
                      botting of alt accounts which slowed down the platform,
                      and people were just logging in for Tix, not because they
                      wanted to play the game.

                      could buy and sell Robux and Tix, and it was basically a
                      speculative market where lots of users made Robux profits

                        The botting also meant that accounts were piling up Tix
                        and converting them to Robux, effectively giving them
                        free “money”

                      . Given all this, Tix was cancelled in 2016. Play to earn
                      will incentivise people making multiple accounts and
                      create an inauthentic user experience, ultimately harming
                      the game in the long-run. Roblox realised this years ago
                      and moved to fix it.

                      Games are centralised, they have to be centralised. Bots
                      need to be banned, cheaters need to be banned, games need
                      to be upgraded etc. Putting game assets on a blockchain is
                      just inefficient, there’s no real benefit to it. Ubisoft
                      or Activision don’t need to put game assets on the
                      blockchain when all the rest of your data is stored on
                      their servers. On Roblox, you can already buy and sell
                      accessories. Roblox isn’t going to rug pull you or
                      anything. In fact, there’s even concepts such as “

                      The thing is with Roblox collectibles is that they
                      actually have a use case, it’s not a total speculative
                      dumpyard, but there are so many games on Roblox and users
                      want to be able to customise their appearance as to
                      enhance their experience. It’s clear Roblox is an
                      extremely popular game (technically a collection of
                      games). It’s game first, collectibles second. It’s
                      extremely difficult to make a good game, and that is
                      undermined when developers focus on NFTs and tokens
                      instead of the fundamental design of the game.
                      Financialising every aspect of games is going to be a
                      disaster, since that’s not the purpose of gaming at all.
                      At the rate we’re going with “GameFi”, I would not be
                      surprised if someone created a DeFi exchange for trading
                      options on in-game NFTs.

                      The whole narrative being peddled that NFTs can bring in
                      interoperability between games and whatever is rubbish.
                      Each game is different, interoperability requires
                      standardisation across games as well as developers
                      agreeing to share IP, which kills their game uniqueness!

                      Also, you can buy and sell in-game items for real money on

                      It’s not a technological revolution or something. And if

                      but NFTs in gaming really look like a solution looking for
                      a problem to me.

                      Narratives can be moulded, but unfortunately crypto gaming
                      evangelists will not be able to change basic economics.
                      The fact that the problem with the Mundell-Fleming
                      trilemma and how crypto games fall on the wrong side of
                      them from a pure game design perspective which ultimately
                      prevent large developers from creating AAA games with open
                      economies as well as ruining user experience is totally
                      ignored by VCs who are funnelling absurd amounts of money
                      into these projects makes me question if they actually
                      believe in the narrative they’re pushing, or if they’re
                      simply investing in token pre-sales and planning on
                      dumping on unwitting retail bagholders.

                      For the record, I’m not a crypto hater or anything, things
                      like being able to send dollars cross-border without
                      stringent KYC/AML is pretty cool, and that’s happening a
                      lot in emerging markets. I’ve personally used a lot of
                      DeFi protocols on Solana and it’s actually pretty fun, all
                      I’m against is false narratives being peddled and dumping
                      what are effectively unregistered securities on clueless
                      retail investors. There’s also clear use cases for
                      blockchain technology in finance, JPM is building repo
                      markets using distributed ledger technology with basically
                      instant settlement and interest being calculated up to the
                      minute (albeit this is a much more centralised process,
                      it’s a blockchain within a regulated walled garden, unlike
                      say Ethereum or Solana which are open).

                      However, I just don’t see the application of decentralised
                      blockchains in gaming, there isn’t a need. Putting games
                      on the blockchain will just result in really slow servers
                      as everything would constantly have to be verified by a
                      decentralised database. No one gamer has ever said: “I
                      don’t trust Rockstar to store my data correctly which is
                      why I won’t buy GTA V”. Building games for the sole
                      purpose of “play to earn” or “play to own” means that
                      players are no longer playing games for enjoyment, but
                      rather the hope that they can monetise their holdings.
                      Inevitably, this means that the quality of game experience
                      will drop, as developers focus solely on how to turn every
                      single aspect of a game into an NFT which can be traded.
                      Collectible trading should be{" "}

                      or Cryptopunks. Recreating games to have a similiar
                      culture will not work out.

                      Also, given that crypto mining is the very reason gamers
                      are getting extorted on their GPUs, I doubt many are going
                      to be enthusiastic at something that will contribute to
                      that squeeze even further. All one has to see is the{" "}

                      backlash Ubisoft recently faced through trying to
                      introduce NFTs. Analysts attribute it to the fact that
                      gamers are worried about climate change (lol, that’s not
                      why gamers hate NFTs). It’s actually the fact that gamers
                      see NFTs as ruining the in-game experience, as it means
                      that people who have nothing to do with the game will be
                      buying NFTs from game developers, hoping to flip them to
                      other speculators. Hence developer incentives will then be
                      skewed towards ensuring expanding supply of NFTs to
                      speculators, which might not even be very useful inside
                      the game. Games are designed for people to have intrinsic
                      fun, they’re not optimised for speculators to try and make
                      as much money as possible.

                      In response to a few DMs, I just want to make it clear
                      that this is a critique of crypto gaming as it is,
                      specifically the Play to Earn model which is being touted
                      as the future of gaming. The reason I say I don’t think
                      crypto gaming is the future is the path this “web3 gaming”
                      group is going down. Just look around you, listen to the
                      new Bankless Podcast on crypto gaming and you’ll see what

                      Making a normal game and then using all revenues from
                      in-game sales to do buybacks of the token as a way to
                      return capital to early backers, as well as voting on key
                      game updates/protocol decisions is basically the only way
                      I see this working, and that would be actually quite
                      interesting. Imagine you paid to Call of Duty Black Ops,
                      but the earnings go to a DAO instead of Activision. You
                      could easily have more community engagement via the
                      governance token, and could end up with more optimal
                      outcomes. Having the governance token could also allow for
                      holders to get a discount on in-game purchases, giving it
                      some sort of real utility similiar to FTT or BNB
                      (discounts on CEX trading fees). If Activision brought out
                      $BLIZZ which gives users discounts on in-game purchases,
                      it would definitely have utility and not be a total
                      shitcoin like SLP which is just a coin to continue Axie’s
                      scheme. Unfortunately, the sustainable path isn’t the path
                      web3 gaming is going down, we’re all pretending that by
                      enticing players through endless token inflation and a
                      quasi pyramid schemes that this is the future. It isn’t.
                      We all know it.

                      My thesis that crypto gaming isn’t the future *can* be
                      proven wrong. By building sustainable games, maybe, just
                      maybe, web3 can bring something good to the gaming
                      industry. But not at all in the way it is doing now. No
                      way. Not everything has to be on-chain. 0x has an
                      off-chain order book for its DEX, but on-chain settlement.
                      The future will have to be a mix of centralised and
                      decentralised. I don’t see what can be decentralised about
                      games except maybe in-game customisations as NFTs
                      (although this is a more inefficient way of doing things
                      currently, maybe it works out because *the culture*), but
                      from a purely technical perspective having blockchains for
                      hosting all in-game data will make games incredibly slow.
                      Gamers hate slow stuff, just like how traders hate latency
                      (hence off-chain order book DEXs). In conclusion, if web3
                      gaming continues down the path its on, it’s 100% doomed to
                      fail. It might have a better chance by adopting a tad bit
                      of common sense. Maybe centralised games but with
                      governance tokens are the key to unlocking web3 gaming? I
                      have no idea. But Play to Earn gaming definitely isn’t it.

                      One of the most amazing things about the Internet is how
                      it provides a level playing field for everyone: this post
                      that you are reading was written by a single person, and
                      it is just as accessible as an article written by the New
                      York Times, or a proclamation issued by the President of
                      the United States.

                      It used to be that media organizations had a big advantage
                      by virtue of owning printing presses and delivery trucks,
                      or broadcast licenses; celebrities and politicians would
                      have their proclamations carried across those same mediums
                      by virtue of their popularity or power. The same
                      advantages applied to other areas of the economy like
                      retail and consumer packaged goods: building physical
                      stores is a big barrier of entry if you want to be the
                      former, and having a large and popular set of products
                      gave big companies access to those retail channels.

                      What is common to both examples was the importance of
                      controlling physical space, but that control came with
                      inherent limitations: a paper newspaper could not be
                      delivered everywhere, and TV broadcasts were limited by
                      the signal strength of broadcast towers. Stores had to be
                      built, and packaged goods had to be stocked on shelves.

                      The Internet changes all of that: now articles and videos
                      are simply digital bits, easily created and easily
                      transmitted anywhere on the globe, effectively for free.
                      Physical goods still need to be made, but they can be sold
                      to anyone by anyone, and shelf space has been replaced by
                      the commoditized cardboard box.

                      This first order reality, though, has had a multitude of
                      second order effects. Newspapers, for example, were
                      amongst the first online sites, and it seemed like a
                      massive boon: now an article that was only accessible by
                      those within a limited geographic area delineated by the
                      reach of delivery trucks could be read by anyone in the
                      world. The problem is that that same reach was available
                      to everyone; back in 2014 I wrote in{" "}

                    One of the great paradoxes for newspapers today is that
                    their financial prospects are inversely correlated to their
                    addressable market. Even as advertising revenues have fallen
                    off a cliff — adjusted for inflation, ad revenues are at the
                    same level as the 1950s — newspapers are able to reach
                    audiences not just in their hometowns but literally all over
                    the world.

                        The problem for publishers, though, is that the free
                        distribution provided by the Internet is not an
                        exclusive. It’s available to every other newspaper as
                        well. Moreover, it’s also available to publishers of any
                        type, even bloggers like myself.

                        To be clear, this is absolutely a boon, particularly for
                        readers, but also for any writer looking to have a broad
                        impact. For your typical newspaper, though, the
                        competitive environment is diametrically opposed to what
                        they are used to: instead of there being a scarce amount
                        of published material, there is an overwhelming
                        abundance. More importantly, this shift in the
                        competitive environment has fundamentally changed just
                        who has economic power.

                      Most of my discussion of Aggregation Theory has been about
                      economics and concepts like zero marginal costs; just as
                      it doesn’t cost anything to publish, it doesn’t cost
                      Google anything (on a marginal basis) to help every person
                      in the world find the specific piece of content they are
                      looking for. This, by extension, motivates publishers to
                      work well with Google, motivates users to use Google more,
                      and gives Google the best possible opportunity to show
                      ads, attracting more and more advertising.

                      In other words, centralization is a second order effect of
                      decentralization: when all constraints on content are
                      removed, more power than ever accrues to the entity that
                      is the preferred choice for navigating that content;
                      moreover, that power compounds on itself in a virtuous
                      feedback loop.

                      This dynamic, though, goes beyond economics; consider the
                      meme that inspired the title of this Article:

                      This meme has, for rather obvious reasons, made a fair
                      number of people upset, particularly to the extent it
                      suggests that support for a country fighting for its
                      existence in the face of a brutal invasion is somehow
                      inauthentic. I think, though, that interpretation is too
                      literal; after all, the meme can be extended in lots of
                      different ways:

                      What I think is captured here is orthogonal to the actual
                      issue at hand (in the case of Musk’s version, Ukraine);
                      the entire point of the generic labeling (“The Current
                      Thing”) is that there is a dynamic that exists independent
                      of the issue being critiqued, and my contention in this
                      Article is that said dynamic is Aggregation Theory for
                      ideas.

                      Go back to the point about the explosion of content on the
                      Internet: the first order implication is that there is an
                      explosion of ideas; after all, anyone can publish
                      anything. Presumably this means that there are far more
                      categories of thought than ever before! And, if you dig
                      deep enough into the Internet, this is true.

                      Most people, though, don’t dig that deep, just as they
                      don’t dig that deep for content or contacts or commerce:
                      it’s just far easier and more convenient to rely on Google
                      or Facebook or Amazon. Why wouldn’t this same dynamic
                      apply to ideas? Being informed about everything happening
                      in the world is hard if not impossible: humans evolved to
                      care intensely about what happened in their local
                      environment; however, first mass media, and then the
                      Internet, brought news from everywhere to our immediate
                      attention.

                      Given that, it seems entirely reasonable — expected even —
                      that we all outsource our intuition for what events
                      matter, and what our position on those events should be,
                      to the most convenient option, especially if that option
                      has obvious moral valence. Police brutality against people
                      of color is obviously bad; people dying from COVID is
                      obviously bad; Russia invading Ukraine is obviously bad;
                      why wouldn’t each of us snap into opposition to obviously
                      bad things?

                      This dynamic is exactly what the meme highlights: sure,
                      the Internet makes possible a wide range of viewpoints —
                      you can absolutely find critics of Black Lives Matter,
                      COVID policies, or pro-Ukraine policies — but the
                      Internet, thanks to its lack of friction and instant
                      feedback loops, also makes nearly every position but the
                      dominant one untenable. If everyone believes one thing,
                      the costs of believing something else increase
                      dramatically, making the consensus opinion the only viable
                      option; this is the same dynamic in which publishers
                      become dependent on Google or Facebook, or retailers on
                      Amazon, just because that is where money can be made.

                      Again, to be very clear, that does not mean the opinion is
                      wrong; as I noted, I think the resonance of this meme is
                      orthogonal to the rightness of the position it is
                      critiquing, and is instead concerned with the sense that
                      there is something unique about the depth of sentiment
                      surrounding issues that don’t necessarily apply in any
                      real-life way to the people feeling said sentiment.

                      Here I think it is useful to go back to economics. The

                      A similar critique can be made of ideas; I thought this
                      tweet was very well-stated:

                      It is very counter-intuitive to see how “bad” ideas are in
                      fact extremely valuable: not only do they highlight why
                      the good ideas are better, but they also sometimes show
                      that the “good” ideas are in fact wrong. Arguing that the
                      earth was not the center of the universe was once a “bad”
                      idea; it was also correct. At the same time, to think that
                      the Catholic church of 500 years ago was the only time
                      where the dominant mode of thinking clearly missed the
                      mark seems exceptionally arrogant; we rightly believe that
                      allowing room for dissidents was, in the past, a good
                      thing. It seems clear to me that doing the same today is
                      likely to prove more valuable than not.

                      Here is the problem: it turns out it was much easier to
                      believe in the value of dissidents in a world of
                      meaningful marginal costs for the propagation of ideas.
                      Most people never encountered contrary opinions when
                      spreading said opinions entailed publishing them on paper
                      and spreading them in the physical world; on the Internet,
                      on the other hand, bad ideas are{" "}

                      . Moreover, the means by which to suppress those opinions
                      are far more obvious: instead of having to shut down a
                      printing press, one only needs to pressure those same
                      centralized Aggregators that arose for economic reasons to
                      suppress “wrong” speech.

                      The end result is a world where the ability for anyone to
                      post any idea has, paradoxically, meant far greater mass
                      adoption of popular ideas and far more effective
                      suppression of “bad” ideas. That is invigorating when one
                      feels the dominant idea is righteous; it seems reasonable
                      to worry about the potential of said sense of
                      righteousness overwhelming the consideration of whether
                      particular courses of action are actually good or bad.

                    It makes sense to think about these positions of the stack
                    very differently: the top of the stack is about broadcasting
                    — reaching as many people as possible — and while you may
                    have the right to say anything you want, there is no right
                    to be heard. Internet service providers, though, are about
                    access — having the opportunity to speak or hear in the
                    first place. In other words, the further down the stack, the
                    more legality should be the sole criteria for moderation;
                    the further up the more discretion and even responsibility
                    there should be for content:

                        Note the implications for Facebook and YouTube in

                        discretionary decisions made by managers seeking to
                        attract the broadest customer base; the appropriate
                        regulatory response, if one is appropriate, should be to
                        push for more competition so that those dissatisfied

                      to cut-off backbone capacity to Russia feels like a

                      infrastructure, with no user-facing presence; it follows
                      that they should not be making any decisions based on
                      political considerations (with Carl von Clausewitz’s
                      observation that “war is simply the continuation of
                      political intercourse with the addition of other means” in

                      country hit with the most comprehensive set of sanctions

                      At the same time, I can’t help but worry about a world
                      where every level of the Internet stack feels empowered to
                      act based on political considerations, and it makes me

                      along with the current thing is irresistible, making any
                      sort of sober consideration of one’s position in the stack
                      irrelevant. The only effective counter is a blanket policy
                      of not censoring or cutting off service under any
                      circumstance: it’s easier to appeal to consistency than it
                      is to make a nuanced decision that runs counter to the
                      current thing.

                      It seems foolhardy to think that this might be true for
                      economics and not true for ideas, even — especially! — if

                      I wrote a fair bit last year about the disconnect between
                      how companies were being valued and the fundamentals of
                      those businesses. It seemed to me that many companies,
                      from the founders, to the leadership teams, and the rank
                      and file employees got more focused on raising capital and
                      valuations than the basics of a business (people, product,
                      customers, revenues, profits, etc).

                      That is starting to shift. I can feel it. With the public
                      markets bringing high flyers back to reality, you can now
                      buy the best companies out there at multiples of earnings
                      and profits that make some sense in a historical context.
                      And we are seeing reports that many mutual funds and hedge
                      funds are leaving the private markets because the values
                      in the public markets are so compelling. All of this is
                      healthy.

                      Business models need to be sustainable. Teams need to
                      stick together and ship things. The fundamentals need to
                      be in place for a business to succeed. All the money in
                      the world at eye-popping valuations won’t do that for you.

                      I have no idea if we are in for another crypto winter. I
                      have no idea if the stock market will continue to go down.
                      I have no idea if the slump in the public markets will
                      seep into the private markets. All of those questions are
                      above my pay grade.

                      What I do know is that the businesses that focus on the
                      fundamentals will succeed in any market, up or down. And I
                      do feel that there is more of that going on in 2022 than
                      we saw in 2020 and 2021 and that’s a very good thing.

                      <em>
                        I turned 30 last week and a friend asked me if I'd
                        figured out any life advice in the past decade worth
                        passing on. I'm somewhat hesitant to publish this
                        because I think these lists usually seem hollow, but
                        here is a cleaned up version of my answer:

                      1) Never put your family, friends, or significant other
                      low on your priority list. Prefer a handful of truly close
                      friends to a hundred acquaintances. Don’t lose touch with
                      old friends. Occasionally stay up until the sun rises
                      talking to people. Have parties.

                      2) Life is not a dress rehearsal—this is probably it. Make
                      it count. Time is extremely limited and goes by fast. Do
                      what makes you happy and fulfilled—few people get
                      remembered hundreds of years after they die anyway. Don’t
                      do stuff that doesn’t make you happy (this happens most
                      often when other people want you to do something). Don’t
                      spend time trying to maintain relationships with people
                      you don’t like, and cut negative people out of your life.
                      Negativity is really bad. Don’t let yourself make excuses
                      for not doing the things you want to do.

                      3) How to succeed: pick the right thing to do (this is
                      critical and usually ignored), focus, believe in yourself
                      (especially when others tell you it’s not going to work),
                      develop personal connections with people that will help
                      you, learn to identify talented people, and work hard.
                      It’s hard to identify what to work on because original
                      thought is hard.

                    <span>
                      4) On work: it’s difficult to do a great job on work you
                      don’t care about. And it’s hard to be totally
                      happy/fulfilled in life if you don’t like what you do for
                      your work. Work very hard—a surprising number of people
                      will be offended that you choose to work hard—but not so
                      hard that the rest of your life passes you by. Aim to be
                      the best in the world at whatever you do professionally.
                      Even if you miss, you’ll probably end up in a pretty good
                      place. Figure out your own productivity system—don’t waste
                      time being unorganized, working at suboptimal times, etc.
                      Don’t be afraid to take some career risks, especially
                      early on. Most people pick their career fairly
                      randomly—really think hard about what you like, what
                      fields are going to be successful, and try to talk to
                      people in those fields.

                      5) On money: Whether or not money can buy happiness, it
                      can buy freedom, and that’s a big deal. Also, lack of
                      money is very stressful. In almost all ways, having enough
                      money so that you don’t stress about paying rent does more
                      to change your wellbeing than having enough money to buy
                      your own jet. Making money is often more fun than spending
                      it, though I personally have never regretted money I’ve
                      spent on friends, new experiences, saving time, travel,
                      and causes I believe in.

                      6) Talk to people more. Read more long content and less

                      7) Don’t waste time. Most people waste most of their time,

                      8) Don’t let yourself get pushed around. As Paul Graham
                      once said to me, “People can become formidable, but it’s
                      hard to predict who”. (There is a big difference between
                      confident and arrogant. Aim for the former, obviously.)

                    <span>
                      9) Have clear goals for yourself every day, every year,
                      and every decade.

                      10) However, as valuable as planning is, if a great
                      opportunity comes along you should take it. Don’t be
                      afraid to do something slightly reckless. One of the
                      benefits of working hard is that good opportunities will
                      come along, but it’s still up to you to jump on them when
                      they do.

                      11) Go out of your way to be around smart, interesting,
                      ambitious people. Work for them and hire them (in fact,
                      one of the most satisfying parts of work is forging deep
                      relationships with really good people). Try to spend time
                      with people who are either among the best in the world at
                      what they do or extremely promising but totally unknown.
                      It really is true that you become an average of the people
                      you spend the most time with.

                      12) Minimize your own cognitive load from distracting
                      things that don’t really matter. It’s hard to overstate
                      how important this is, and how bad most people are at it.
                      Get rid of distractions in your life. Develop very strong
                      ways to avoid letting crap you don’t like doing pile up
                      and take your mental cycles, especially in your work life.

                      13) Keep your personal burn rate low. This alone will give
                      you a lot of opportunities in life.

                      15) Don’t worry so much. Things in life are rarely as
                      risky as they seem. Most people are too risk-averse, and
                      so most advice is biased too much towards conservative
                      paths.

                      17) If you think you’re going to regret not doing
                      something, you should probably do it. Regret is the worst,
                      and most people regret far more things they didn’t do than
                      things they did do. When in doubt, kiss the boy/girl.

                      fact, in your 20s, I think it’s ok to take a “Give me

                      money in the world will never get back time that passed

                      24) Do new things often. This seems to be really
                      important. Not only does doing new things seem to slow
                      down the perception of time, increase happiness, and keep
                      life interesting, but it seems to prevent people from
                      calcifying in the ways that they think. Aim to do
                      something big, new, and risky every year in your personal
                      and professional life.

                      30) Existential angst is part of life. It is particularly
                      noticeable around major life events or just after major
                      career milestones. It seems to particularly affect smart,
                      ambitious people. I think one of the reasons some people
                      work so hard is so they don’t have to spend too much time
                      thinking about this. Nothing is wrong with you for feeling
                      this way; you are not alone.

                      There is a lot of criticism of venture capital in web3.
                      Bitcoin did not have or need venture capital. Ethereum did
                      not have or need venture capital. So why would any web3
                      project need venture capital? It is a good question. In
                      the age of community-funded projects, why would a web3
                      project want to take funding from venture capitalists?

                      , Packy describes the challenges that the Dapper Labs team
                      went through between late 2017, when CryptoKitties
                      launched, and the summer of 2020, when Top Shot launched.

                      What Packy lays out is a series of notes that the venture
                      capitalists (including yours truly) provided to Dapper
                      during the last crypto winter that kept the project alive.
                      As Packy says:

                    In Dapper’s case, VCs kept the company alive during the bear
                    market and the company sold tokens to the public at the same
                    price it sold them to VCs, even though VCs invested first.

                      That latter bit is quite important. After Top Shot
                      launched and it was clear that Dapper and Flow were gonna
                      make it, Dapper offered Flow tokens to the community at
                      the same price that the venture capitalists got in the
                      conversion of the notes.

                      There are many alternatives to venture capital these days,

                      Well it seems I broke my streak of publishing these on my
                      birthday. Oh well, better to still get it out late than
                      not get it out at all.

                      So once again it was a crazy year and I’m amazed by how
                      different life is now than it was last year. But surely
                      this year will be different…

                      There’s a computer science challenge where you have to
                      figure out how to design a program to find the optimal
                      solution, when there are many locally optimal but not
                      globally optimal solutions it could get distracted by.

                      To get around this you have to introduce some randomness
                      into the system. It needs to make occasionally suboptimal
                      short term decisions in order to reach the best long-term
                      solution.

                      Each of us is climbing our own mountain, and it’s tempting
                      to always focus on going up because going down or asking
                      if we picked the right mountain is scary. We don’t want to
                      give up the hike and have to start again.

                      But like the computer program, if we climb to the top of
                      the first mountain we pick, there’s a near-zero chance
                      we’ve picked the best mountain. Sometimes we have to look
                      around and say “you know, that mountain might be better.”

                      Writing is the only work I do completely for itself.
                      Everything else is at least partially motivated by money,
                      since it turns out money is kinda useful and the more of
                      it you can make faster the less you have to make later. At
                      least in theory. So while I was pretty set on writing for
                      the meaningful work mountain, I knew there was still some
                      searching to do for the best money mountain.

                      The search worked. Last year was more lucrative than I
                      could have expected to achieve from content marketing or
                      course making without selling out. And I had fun doing it!
                      Depending on the goal, sometimes the best way to achieve
                      it is to abandon the current path and find another. If my
                      goal is to reach a comfortable enough degree of financial
                      independence to focus on writing full time, without having
                      to write “what will make money,” crypto work is a much
                      better mountain.

                      And while it is scary to walk back down the mountain to
                      try again, you at least should have some good hiking
                      muscles. You never know how the skills you built on one

                      One mentality I’ve often railed against is the long-term
                      career plan encouraged in college. You need to study hard
                      to get good grades to get that first job so you can get
                      promoted over the next 20 years and become a partner and
                      then all your problems will be solved and you’ll be
                      eternally happy. Something like that.

                      I’m more a fan of the driving in the fog analogy. You have
                      a rough idea of where you are and where you want to go
                      towards, but you can only see a little bit ahead of you,
                      and you have to keep making progress based on that. And
                      the less committed you are to a certain outcome, the freer
                      you are to take the roads that make the most sense for
                      you.

                      For the last 7 years since I graduated, I’ve rarely
                      thought about work and progress on a longer than 1-2 year
                      timescale. With Growth Machine the focus was always on
                      hitting the next revenue milestone or fixing the next
                      problem. With this blog I’ve never really had any goals,
                      it just keeps growing. With starting down this crypto road
                      last year my only goal was to figure out some way to make
                      money within a year so I didn’t have to live entirely off
                      savings and passive income.

                      Even outside of crypto though, there’s always that sense

                      Having a kid has made me zoom out a little and look at
                      money on a 25 year timescale. If I’m 29 now, and my last
                      kid might turn 18 in 25 or so years, then I just need to
                      make enough to give them the life I want them to have
                      between now and then, and to give Cosette and I the life

                      retire and chill on the beach even if I did. So letting
                      myself stop obsessing over trying to grow our wealth as
                      fast as possible, and thinking instead about what kinds of
                      habits will work out well over 25 years has been a great
                      way to reframe things.

                      I’ve written extensively about note taking and
                      productivity in the past, and one of the common themes in

                      Why physical? If you’ve spent a little time on computers
                      you probably know that more information is not always
                      better. When you plug a query into Google and get
                      10,000,000 results, most of those are not particularly
                      helpful. Quality is more important than quantity in an age
                      of such abundance. And most people who use a note taking
                      tool and who save their book highlights know you almost
                      never go back and review those highlights.

                      So by creating a physical zettlekasten for my favorite
                      notes, I’ve added a final filtering step to make sure that
                      whatever goes in the box is a high quality idea I’m
                      confident I want to remind myself of in the future. By
                      having to write it out by hand, I’m forcing myself to be
                      much more selective than when I can simply copy and paste

                      Think about how much more meaningful it is to get an ecard
                      vs a physical card. The ecard is much lower effort, it
                      takes time and energy to pick out a physical card and give
                      it to someone. Effort is what gives the card and your

                      Our knowledge management too should be effortful and
                      deliberate, or else we will fill our libraries with
                      trivia, and then what was the point of doing the
                      organizing in the first place. There’s also a certain
                      permanence to it. Sure my notes and library could burn
                      down in a fire, but it could also be something my kids
                      leaf through in 30 years. That’s fun to think about.

                      You might have periods of intense focus with very high
                      output, and then extended periods of rest and
                      recuperation. Most of my very productive work tends to get
                      done in a total of one to two months of the year.
                      Theoretically, if I could isolate those time periods, I
                      could work a lot less and relax a lot more.

                      But we have to be careful about that naive interpretation
                      of this cycle. Having periods of very high output does not
                      mean the other periods are wasted. Those rest periods are
                      what lay the groundwork for the bursts of productivity. If
                      we force ourselves to have extremely high output every
                      week, it’s more likely that we’ll just burn ourselves out
                      or drain all our creativity.

                      It’s easy to look at one side of the pendulum and go
                      “that’s the good side, I want the arm to always be on that
                      side.” But the only way it gets to that side is by
                      swinging there. When the pendulum is swinging back and
                      forth it ends up on that side effortlessly. Gravity works
                      with you. If you try to permanently keep it on that side,
                      you’re constantly in a battle against gravity. I’d rather
                      have the forces of nature on my side than against me.

                      Enjoying rest also requires having something to rest from.
                      If we try to live a life of perpetual ease, we’ll get
                      restless or succumb to ennui. We need those periods of
                      intense focus and meaningful work so we have something to
                      pour our potential energy into as it builds up at the
                      opposite peak.

                      Cycles, tides, seasons, the natural world is full of these
                      ebbs &amp; flows. We want to fix everything to convenient

                      I hit that goal, and the next one, and it turns out that
                      hitting your lifestyle, passive income, net worth, and

                      My interest now is actually in removing financial
                      complexity. More than a certain amount of money, I don’t

                      One of the best investments you can make is in your
                      community. It’s tough to make friends and be constantly

                      media, but everyone wants to spend time IRL with people

                      Hosting is a great way to facilitate this. Bringing
                      together groups for dinners, breakfasts, coffee,
                      adventures, parties, whatever, is something everyone
                      enjoys and appreciates but are often hesitant to initiate
                      themselves. It’s really worth making the effort to
                      initiate these get-togethers.

                      Constantly planning things gets exhausting though, which
                      is why rituals are so helpful. Having pre-set times and

                      see each other, without having to rely on one point person

                      For free-to-play games, and especially for those with
                      in-app purchases, it is important to determine how well
                      the game will do globally and if it has a good retention
                      profile and monetisation mechanics.

                      profitable and you should aim for a global launch or
                      simply kill it.

                      If you plan on looking for a publisher for your game, you
                      should be aware that many publishers will look for some
                      soft launch data before committing to any sort of monetary
                      guarantee. Therefore, doing your own soft launch is highly
                      recommended, as it will put you in a much better position
                      during negotiations.

                      In my humble opinion, the most important part of game
                      development. Market research is the process of looking at
                      the game market through numbers, facts and opinions. It’s
                      about finding the equilibrium between what the audience
                      wants, what your teams want to build and what your teams
                      actually can build, scale and operate. This step will give
                      you some ideas about what you can expect while making and
                      operating your game. Thorough market research should also
                      help you to identify the challenges you’ll face in
                      production and marketing allowing you to mitigate them in
                      advance.

                      Researching key players in your game’s genre can give you
                      some great insights into what your target audience values
                      in a game. You need to do some homework and answer these

                      The obvious strategy for your mobile game is, of course,
                      to try to make a game that appeals to your target audience
                      and at the same time stands out from the crowd of similar
                      games. But how do you know, who exactly your target
                      audience is and what it wants?

                      The usual way to identify your game’s target audience is
                      to use game categories. If you are making an RPG game, you
                      can check out the best performing RPG games in your
                      market, analyse them and try to learn their strengths and
                      weaknesses. It’s natural because you aim to focus on
                      RPG-enthusiasts. Well, you can surely have some success
                      with that logic, but you are also severely narrowing your
                      view and creating unnecessary blind spots. And these blind
                      spots can cost you a lot of potential gamers and daily
                      revenue. Games usually focus on primary and secondary
                      target audiences.

                      – Candy Crush is a casual browser/mobile Match 3 game. The
                      audience of Candy Crush consists mostly of female gamers
                      and also much older gamers. These gamers focus on
                      Completion (collecting and finishing everything) and
                      almost every other motivation factor is low. So the
                      primary focus is on the middle-aged female audience that
                      is interested in match-3 genre and cares mostly about
                      achievement over all other aspects of the game, but also
                      aim to entertain male audiences with hard puzzles in the
                      later stage of the game.

                      Determining the target audience is key to reaching the
                      loyal and high-profit players, in order to ensure the ROI
                      (return on investment). To effectively determine the
                      game’s target audience, game developers should consider
                      the three main general aspects of target audience
                      grouping: demographics, psychographics and motivation.

                      Players play mobile games for different reasons. Most
                      gamers, from their own gameplay experiences and playing
                      with others online, have some taxonomy of some of these
                      gameplay preferences. Over the past two decades, academic
                      researchers and game developers have proposed many models
                      and frameworks to codify these differences. There is
                      certainly no shortage of models that describe players

                      Despite a large number of models companies use, there has
                      been a relative lack of quantitative data backing up most
                      of those models. From a statistical point of view, the
                      following issues have typically not been addressed
                      quantitatively. Quantic Foundry developed, based on the
                      motivation definitions or existing survey scales,
                      brainstormed a few items for each of the motivations. For
                      example, for Challenge: “take the time to practice and
                      master a game” and “play the game at the highest

                      Most developers know how to test concepts and do this
                      early on to mitigate the risk of the investment. Since
                      concept testing is extremely cost-effective, there is no
                      reason for other developers not to do it as well. The app
                      store platforms are becoming more competitive every day.
                      The best way to gain an advantage in this saturated space
                      is to identify more accurately which concepts will appeal
                      to the widest audience. Concept testing helps you make
                      these important product development decisions using
                      concrete data, and it plays a critical role in revealing
                      how people make their own decisions and which messages
                      convince them to install.

                      is its flexibility. To enhance your learnings, you can use
                      surveys. To obtain player feedback, you can create a
                      redirect on the test app store page that directs people to
                      a survey. These questions can cover game mechanics,
                      characters, feature set, core loop, monetisation, spending
                      behaviour, how often players play games and more. These
                      survey questions are invaluable to:

                      A successful soft launch is the best way to optimise your
                      mobile game for global launch. The Build, measure &amp;
                      Learn loop is a product development principle that
                      emphasises speed of iteration as a key component in
                      product development.

                      If you’re not familiar with how to manage an ad waterfall
                      or the mediation set up at this stage I would recommend
                      relying solely on Unity ads. Once you’ve set up ads, the
                      North Star KPI you should track at this stage is
                      Impression per DAU. Generally, an IMP/DAU above 4.0 means
                      the Rewarded Video (RV) placements you’ve placed in the
                      game will impact your UA efforts in a meaningful way. If
                      you’re coming in below this number you either have to
                      change the RV placements, RV rewards or accept that the Ad
                      revenue will not make up a significant portion of your
                      revenue. If you’re only using one ad partner at this
                      stage, it is a good general rule of thumb that once you
                      add a mediation platform you’ll increase your ad revenue
                      by 100%. Then with a proper mediation setup you’ll further
                      increase the ad revenue by another 25%.

                      How long should we be in the soft launch? There is no
                      correct answer to this. The goal of soft launch is not to
                      be in a “tweaking mode” forever and step by step improve
                      the game. Not every time it’s possible.

                      Most frequent question in soft launching: Is my CPI good?
                      How does it compare to other games? While there was a
                      Chartboost CPI benchmarks website, that is really obsolete
                      and far from the truth. Here are again some examples I can
                      share to get the idea about how CPIs vary in between GEOs
                      and different optimizations as well:

                      Beta program is gaining popularity amongst game
                      developers, Google has done a pretty good job of giving
                      game publishers the tools that they need to make their
                      games the best they can be. The benefits of beta testing
                      are obvious, you can test your game with specific groups
                      or open your test to Google Play users. Available testing
                      options include Internal testing, available only to people
                      inside of your organisation; Closed testing, available to
                      a larger set of testers but not publicly available; and
                      Open testing, which will make pre-release versions of your
                      app available on the Google Play store. Games in the beta
                      testing program don’t get reviews on the store which can
                      be beneficial when something really breaks. All in all, a
                      beta testing program is the way to go in soft launch since
                      you can do the same activities as if your game was live in
                      a limited amount of GEOs.

                      Even before the IDFA shenanigans happened, game developers
                      launched their games in Soft launch on Android. Android
                      was always the go-to platform thanks to the fast review
                      processes and tools available in the developers console.

                      The algorithm in app stores always looks for keywords, a
                      well-written description, and optimised titles. Soft
                      launch is the best time to start with keyword research and
                      optimise your app store visuals. Focus on Icon, screenshot
                      and feature image and test these at least once, but
                      ideally multiple times to get higher chances of improving

                      Soft launch is the time when you work with your data team
                      to set up UA dashboards, integrate tools, monitor KPIs and
                      provide enough players for A/B testing. In the
                      monetisation stage, UA and data teams work hand in hand to
                      create LTV predictions based on the acquired cohorts. This
                      is also why I suggest staying in soft launch for around
                      six months, so you have enough data to build those

                      There’s no doubt that Apple’s iOS 14+ has introduced
                      important measures to safeguard user privacy. But it has
                      also created significant challenges for marketers who have
                      had to adapt to a completely new way of measuring UA
                      campaigns.

                      Before iOS 14, marketers could measure in-depth and at
                      length to determine user/campaign value. But in Apple’s
                      SKAdNetwork, data is far less in-depth and at length…You
                      get 64 combinations from 6 bits to map post-install
                      activity and a few days at best of activity data.

                      My go-to UA channel in the soft launch was (and still is)
                      Facebook. Given the recent quality fluctuations, I started
                      introducing Google UAC and Unity ads very early on in the
                      retention stage. How should your strategy differ when you
                      have a PVP game vs a non-PVP game?

                      You need to keep in mind how many players you need to have
                      statistically significant cohorts to make data driven
                      decisions. If you have a PVP game, liquidity is the key
                      for your matchmaking and therefore the UA team needs to
                      spend continuously to provide a certain amount of daily
                      new users to make it work. Because, as we know, if
                      matchmaking doesn’t work, it can influence the retention
                      numbers and overall feel of the game.

                      Days when Mobile app install (MAI) optimization was the
                      only way to go are gone. While it can drive good quality
                      traffic, it won’t be sufficient in the retention and
                      monetisation stage. When you enter the retention stage,
                      sit down with a data team to identify events in the game
                      (tutorial completion, level 10 achieved, 5 missions
                      played, connect Facebook or share invite) that suggest
                      player engagement and higher quality. Then implement and
                      use these events for optimisation purposes in the App
                      Event Optimisation (AEO) campaigns. Finally, as mentioned
                      before, running AEO Purchase campaigns in the monetisation
                      stage will provide necessary p(l)ayers to evaluate
                      monetisation KPIs of your game.

                      So I clicked on the link to my Competing To Win Deals
                      post, which I wrote in 2010, and read it. I often read
                      things I wrote a decade or more ago and cringe at how out
                      of date they have become. Not this one. It is as relevant
                      today as when I wrote it almost twelve years ago. So I am
                      reposting it below:

                      The venture capital business is highly competitive. There
                      is more money out there chasing good deals than most
                      people imagine. It is also true that there are good deals
                      and good entrepreneurs that can’t find anyone to invest in
                      them. That is a failure of the system. But this post is
                      not about that. It is about how a VC can compete and win a
                      deal that many others want.

                      1) Do your very best to connect with the entrepreneur. If
                      you don’t have a great personal connection, you won’t win
                      the deal. Don’t even bother to try to win a deal where you
                      don’t have good personal chemistry with the founder/CEO.

                </p>
              </div>
              <div
                id="block-25d5c115c7db48158c3a7ab4461f3310"

                    <span>
                      2) Bring your full partnership into the deal process early
                      and consistently. Entrepreneurs are smart and they know
                      they are doing a deal with a firm as well as an
                      individual. Let them see the full picture early. Make it
                      easy on the entrepreneur to meet the full partnership.
                      Don’t make the entrepreneur do all the work.
                    </span>
                  </span>
                </p>
              </div>
              <div
                id="block-46c572b7a52242f0b7b6c6ec7c916cc1"

                  <span className="notion-semantic-string">
                    <span>
                      3) Encourage the entrepreneur to get feedback on you and
                      your firm. Instead of references, I like to give a list of
                      every entrepreneur I’ve ever worked with and an email
                      address. I tell them “throw a dart at that list and talk
                      to four or five of them randomly. you’ll hear the same
                      thing from everyone.”
                    </span>
                  </span>
                </p>
              </div>
              <div
                id="block-aa055de6bff14e02a5b806461f9fc637"
                className="notion-text"
              >
                <p className="notion-text__content">
                  <span className="notion-semantic-string">
                    <span>
                      4) Don’t pressure the entrepreneur to make a decision.
                      Don’t issue exploding term sheets. Don’t put no shops into
                      your term sheets. Those kinds of things are signs of
                      insecurity. I prefer to tell people that we’ll have an
                      exclusive relationship when the deal closes and not before
                      then. If someone wants to leave me at the altar, better it
                      happens then than after we are married.
                    </span>
                  </span>
                </p>
              </div>
              <div
                id="block-d932d4a97fe646f1b61145abb95635e6"
                className="notion-text"
              >
                <p className="notion-text__content">
                  <span className="notion-semantic-string">
                    <span>
                      5) Make your offer in person and don’t do it via a term
                      sheet. Tell the entrepreneur you want to be their business
                      partner. Tell them how much you will invest and how much
                      ownership you want. Leave it at that. Tell them that if
                      they are interested, you will send them a term sheet.
                      Leading with a term sheet focuses the discussion on the
                      wrong things. The process should be all about personal fit
                      and very high level deal terms. Once the decision is made
                      to try to work together, you can get into the specifics of
                      the deal.
                    </span>
                  </span>
                </p>
              </div>
              <div
                id="block-0c4c3de45e554f1ab2a7aa8a982a3128"
                className="notion-text"
              >
                <p className="notion-text__content">
                  <span className="notion-semantic-string">
                    <span>
                      6) Add value during the process. Talk about the strategy
                      issues facing the company. Talk about the hiring
                      challenges the company faces. Try to help with these
                      issues even before you are an investor. Show what you can
                      do right away.

                id="block-5a289c6ffbac4975978788f29c653613"

                <p className="notion-text__content">
                  <span className="notion-semantic-string">
                    <span>
                      7) Use the product or service. Ideally you should be using
                      it well before you start chasing the deal. But use the
                      product/service actively and smartly. The entreprener will
                      be watching. I assure you of that.
                    </span>
                  </span>
                </p>
              </div>
              <div
                id="block-d56fb639512d4250a0c526cd6008b3c0"
                className="notion-text"
              >
                <p className="notion-text__content">
                  <span className="notion-semantic-string">
                    <span>
                      8) Don’t feel the need to pay the highest price. Offering
                      a crazy price to win the deal scares off most smart
                      entrepreneurs. They will be wondering why you are so
                      aggressive. Offering a fair price that is in the range is
                      what you need to do. And communicate that if the
                      entrepreneur chooses to work with you, you will be
                      flexible on your offer. That way you put yourself in the
                      position to win and you can work the specifics to close
                      the deal when the opportunity presents itself.
                    </span>
                  </span>
                </p>
              </div>
              <div
                id="block-46b4a22fd34f41f5a3837dd2fabfa5b0"
                className="notion-text"
              >
                <p className="notion-text__content">
                  <span className="notion-semantic-string">
                    <span>
                      9) Don’t team up with another firm. We’ve made this
                      mistake a few times recently. Entrepreneurs want to choose
                      their syndicate partners. By pairing up with another firm,
                      you signal to the entrepreneur that you want to choose the
                      syndicate and that is a mistake in a highly competitive
                      deal.
                    </span>
                  </span>
                </p>
              </div>
              <div
                id="block-c7c88e0786934bbd910904eb99ab3130"
                className="notion-text"
              >
                <p className="notion-text__content">
                  <span className="notion-semantic-string">
                    <span>
                      10) Be prepared to lose the deal and if you do, lose
                      gracefully. There are plenty of good deals out there. You
                      don’t have to win them all. Lose gracefully and maintain
                      your good relationship with the entrepreneur at all costs.
                      They might come back to you on the next round.
                    </span>

                      Many of these rules are counter intuitive. But they work
                      well for my partners and me. You might say they will only
                      work for you if you are a top tier investor. That may well
                      be true, but you have to act like a top tier investor to
                      become one. So you might as well play the game that way
                      from the start.

                      hit puzzle game Wordle, which has seen a high number of
                      clones emerge following its viral success, as well as
                      numerous games inspired by its simple word-guessing

                      first thing I always do, I go to the Google Play store,
                      and I go, 'Hey, copyright infringement. Can you take this
                      down?' And I send pictures. That one, because it was a bit
                      more complicated than just straight up using our art, I
                      organised a whole folder of pictures for comparison. And
                      the response I got back was, 'We've decided not to take
                      action on this. You can reach out to the developer
                      directly.' What will that achieve? They knowingly cloned
                      the game. The only thing I can possibly do is send them a
                      legal threat. That's costly, and takes a lot of energy,
                      and we're tired. We just released a game! We're still
                      exhausted."

                      dates from 2007, which is well before the current era of
                      hypercasual mobile games. In Nova v Mazooma, the court
                      held that there was copyright in the visual appearance of
                      a game, but the court's approach of comparing screenshots
                      of the respective games does not always do justice to
                      protecting original games. For example, it is difficult to

                      look-and-feel from static screenshots alone.

                      to claimants than the UK, but it generally remains a
                      difficult area to enforce in both law and practice," he
                      continues. "From a practical perspective, enforcement of
                      IP rights in a mobile games context, especially the
                      hypercasual genre, can be difficult as well because of
                      their faster development times, sometimes shorter
                      shelf-life and the cross-border issues associated with
                      platforms, studios and users around the world. Legislators
                      in the UK and other legal systems may wish to consider
                      reforming copyright more generally to make it more fit for
                      the age of the metaverse and the iPhone rather than Telex

                      "In our case, [the reaction] was mostly panic," Ismail
                      recalls. "You go into games [hoping] that your creativity
                      will be rewarded in some way, shape, or form. It turns out
                      when that faith is shaken, it's very scary. Competition in
                      the games industry tends to be in relatively good faith.
                      And clones are the opposite of that. They're the most
                      cynical expression of competition. It's not something that
                      we're used to, in the games industry, even though it
                      happens remarkably often. Most of the games industry is so
                      supportive and so cooperative that even though all of us
                      are competing for the same market space, there's a sort of
                      good sportspersonship going on, and when that gets
                      violated it's shocking.

                      platforms as there's a crossover between mobile players
                      and console/PC players.

                      And it was just hundreds and hundreds of these messages.
                      And then on top of that, we were getting half a dozen
                      emails a day, and just constantly people were coming into
                      our Discord to report this, to the point where our mods
                      were discussing if they were able to come up with some

                      Ultimately, the big question is: what can you do to combat
                      clones? And in reality there's not a whole lot you can do.
                      Or what you can do could legally jeopardise how game
                      development works for future generations.

                      "The biggest fear we had with Ridiculous Fishing is that
                      there was obviously a lot of interest from lawyers who
                      wanted to take on the case and said, 'we can protect your
                      work'," Ismail recalls. "But then other lawyers would say,
                      'we could protect your work but if we succeed it might set
                      precedent as to the protection of game design'. That's
                      scary because if that happens somebody might say, 'Jumping
                      is ours now'. There's precedent in the games industry for
                      patents, but it's usually very specific things like
                      playing mini-games on loading screens.

                      trademark something in Australia, you've got to also
                      trademark it in America, and in Europe, and in New
                      Zealand. You have to pay for each territory that you
                      trademark it in, and across [different] categories. And
                      these costs add up. It's scary how much they add up. So,
                      for an indie studio working on a game, you don't know if
                      the game is going to do well, and you don't have a AAA
                      budget to invest in protecting your game. So, you go,
                      'Well, if it goes well, I'll trademark it then'."

                      The trademarking process can take years sometimes, which
                      is plenty of time for more clones to emerge in the
                      meantime. And while trademarking will protect a name, it
                      doesn't protect gameplay mechanics.

                      are very similar to ours if they don't call them
                      Unpacking, and use their own art. And to be honest, I'm
                      fine with that too. That's how games evolve and how genres
                      evolve. Even if it does mean that there will be some games
                      that are too similar to Unpacking to my liking, they're
                      still not going to be infringing on our brand, and making
                      people confuse their game for ours. They're not profiting

                      imagine that somebody plays your game and then puts it
                      away and sits down at their computer and makes something,"
                      he says. "And for cloning you imagine that they open up
                      your game on the one screen and program their game on the
                      other screen. It's that cynicism that separates the two.

                      Once you visualize the human life span, it becomes clear

                      I love going to the American Museum of Natural History,
                      and I’ve been three times since I moved to New York in
                      2009. If that rate continues, I’ll step into the museum 12
                      more times. For an activity I think of as “something I
                      like to do,” that number seems shockingly low. I also love
                      going to the movies, but ever since it became effortless
                      to stream everything at home, I’ve been averaging one or
                      two movie theater trips a year. In my head, I’ll go out
                      for hundreds more movies in my life, but the real amount
                      is probably some weirdly small number like 53.

                      weeks, but it has robbed us of our favorite activities —
                      experiences that are already in short supply.

                      But perhaps the hardest math to process — and, in turn,
                      the hardest Covid pill to swallow — has to do with our
                      relationships. I grew up spending some time with my
                      parents almost every day. Since turning 19 and moving away
                      for good, I’ve averaged about 10 to 15 days a year with
                      them. If I’m one of the lucky ones, I’ll have quality time
                      with my parents until I’m 60. That means that the day I
                      headed off to college, I had something like 350 remaining
                      parent days{" "}

                      What it boils down to is this: My life, in the best-case
                      scenario, will consist of around 20 years of in-person
                      parent time. The first 19 happened over the course of my
                      first 19 years. The final year is spread out over the rest
                      of my life. When I left for college, I had many decades
                      left with living parents, but only about one year of time
                      left to spend{" "}

                      It’s the same story with childhood friends. I spent high
                      school sitting around with the same four friends, notching
                      somewhere around 1,000 hangouts by the time we scattered
                      off to different cities. Since then, our text thread keeps
                      us in touch, but we’ve only managed to get the whole group
                      together for a weekend every few years — about 10 total
                      days each decade. It feels like we’re smack in the middle
                      of our lives together, but like me and my parents, the
                      high school group is currently enjoying its final 5
                      percent of in-person time together.

                      The pandemic has only added to the sting. In my family,
                      Thanksgiving is the ultimate unskippable event, but over
                      the past two years, we’ve skipped it twice because of
                      Covid. Considering that there may only be 10 or 15 more
                      Thanksgivings for us to be all together, two is a pretty
                      big piece of that pie.

                      We think a lot about those black lines: the roads not
                      taken, the opportunities missed, the ones that got away.
                      But most of us greatly underestimate the size of the lush
                      green tree of possibilities that lie ahead of us.

                      We underestimate future possibilities for the same reason
                      we overestimate the time we have left with those we love:
                      our intuition is not very imaginative. It’s a human
                      instinct to believe the life we’re used to is how things
                      will always be, both the good parts and the bad.

                      Wallowing in regret carries an implicit assumption that we
                      had agency in the past — that we could have{" "}

                      those other life paths if only we had made better
                      decisions. When we think about the future, though, that
                      feeling of agency often disappears, which can leave us
                      feeling resigned and even hopeless.

                      But the life we’ll be living 10 years from now will
                      largely be determined not by our past selves but by our
                      present and future selves. If we imagine what we might

                      something about it now.

                      This is the good news about being a human. The time we
                      have left with family and friends is not a law of nature
                      like the weeks we have left to live. It’s a function of
                      priorities and decisions.

                      At our current pace of 10 to 15 days per year, my parents
                      and I have at best a couple of hundred days left to hang
                      out. But there’s nothing stopping us from changing that
                      equation. Agreeing upon an additional annual family week
                      each summer would almost double our remaining time
                      together, while moving to the same city could multiply it
                      by 10. Getting together with my friends one weekend a year
                      would triple our pace and leave us with 15 percent of our
                      total hangout time ahead, instead of just 5 percent. If
                      the thought of only 12 more Museum of Natural History
                      visits makes me sad, I can start going once a year and
                      magically transform that number to 50. That big green tree
                      is a reminder that we have the power to change so much of
                      what seems set in stone.

                      These two delusions — that we have countless time ahead of
                      us and that we can’t change our course — are a recipe for
                      complacency. Shedding them can wake us up and inspire us
                      to live more wisely. The past couple of years has left us
                      with a joy deficit. When we picture a post-Covid world, we
                      imagine having our old lives back. But we can actually go
                      a step further and make up for the missed experiences,
                      flipping the deficit into a surplus. If Covid has given us
                      anything, it’s a rare chance for a reset. Let’s take it.

                      GDP. In Factorio, players gather resources and craft
                      items, and then automate this process—so a player might
                      start by manually mining coal and iron, then smelt the
                      iron and use it to build a mining drill, the hook up some
                      conveyor belts so the miner automatically sends the iron
                      to a smelter, then hook up conveyor belts to that and uses
                      them to pass these materials on to a factory that
                      mass-produces more conveyor belts, mining drills, and so
                      on.

                      This may sound boring, but how many human-hours per year
                      are spent matching colored gems? Some games get described
                      as meditative, and that's true of Factorio in two senses:
                      first, there's a theme-and-variation aspect to it, where
                      each new product built is some combination of known
                      problems (e.g. one more thing to move on conveyor belts)
                      and new challenges (squirting fluids through pipes, and
                      combining their outputs with solid products to create new
                      items). But it's also meditative in the sense that
                      meditation is partly a way to cultivate a particular
                      mindset, and Factorio does that, too. You can meditate in
                      order to be in the moment; you play Factorio in order to
                      habituate yourself to never leaving a manual process
                      un-automated.

                      Over time, playing the game reveals the metagame: early
                      factories end up poorly laid-out, with redundancies,
                      complex hacky ways of moving products around, and dead
                      ends from which it's impossible to scale. So the basic
                      loop in the game is:

                      The traditional programming term for solving this kind of

                      actually supposed to do, and rewrite something that does

                      This metagame also has some of the flavor of memory
                      management, both in the directly analogous sense that
                      there are finite resources that have to be allocated to
                      different tasks, and in the more metaphorical sense that
                      one of the limits to sloppy scaling is losing track of
                      what you're working on. Building something that isn't
                      resource-constrained is one task, and building something
                      that doesn't overproduce anything of significance is
                      another, more complicated task—but one that's also
                      rewarding, because it makes the problem so easy to keep
                      track of. Ineffective scaling in Factorio can reach a
                      point where players can in principle keep going, but would
                      in practice need to track an elaborate to-do list; in that
                      case, they lose by turning a game into a chore.

                      There are many games that evolve into a metagame; chess
                      has a weird dynamic where players spend the first hour or
                      so memorizing, then spend a while strategizing, and then,
                      later in their career, invest ever more effort in
                      memorizing again; poker starts out being a game of
                      calculating probabilities from limited information and
                      turns into a game of maximizing the information gap with
                      an opponent; player-versus-player videogames games with
                      complicated character builds start out being about
                      reaction time and end up being a matter of identifying the
                      most important stats and pulling every possible lever to
                      maximize those stats; Wordle starts out as an easy but
                      luck-driven vocabulary test and turns into an{" "}

                      . Some games and their surrounding communities find ways
                      to gracefully guide players from the game to the metagame,
                      and they're both enjoyable at different levels. (Blackjack
                      can be perfectly fun even if you're not counting cards,
                      and it’s a judgement call in both directions: the metagame
                      can feel like a boring grind, but ignoring the metagame
                      can be boring in a different way; it means participating
                      as a labor-intensive non-player character.)

                      This metagame ends up giving players the habit of looking
                      at every situation by asking: what's the best way to
                      automate this, and what dependencies of other automations
                      are threatened if I do? This is, for developers and for
                      the many, many people whose jobs will involve more
                      software development over time, a very good habit indeed.
                      I tried to crank through some emails right after playing
                      Factorio one time, and realized—I urgently need to write
                      some email snippets. This just can't be allowed to exist
                      in an un-automated state! But if I'm going to use a lot of
                      email snippets, I need a consistent way to manage them
                      lest I end up with five different iterations on "Yes,
                      let's talk about that; here's my Calendly."

                      This is a good habit. If something is worth doing, there's
                      a good chance it's worth doing equally well at 1,000x the
                      scale. And even if most things don't scale that way, a 1%
                      hit rate on asking that question about equivalently
                      valuable things produces a 10x increase in overall output.
                      It's possible to improve through continuous gradual
                      change, and in some domains that's the only kind of
                      improvement available; you will probably not 50x your
                      deadlift. But the domains where that's not true are an
                      increasing share of overall economic activity, for the
                      basically tautological reason that they’re the ones that
                      end up scaling.

                      It's very valuable to cultivate this habit of seeking
                      opportunities for scaling, even if the payoff is uneven;

                      will end up getting moved to better seats on planes every
                      so often, but if they also negotiate a 2% better raise or
                      offer every single year, their lifetime earnings will be
                      55% higher, and if they fight for higher equity
                      compensation at the right time the results can be very
                      nice indeed. Continuous optimization is a good habit that
                      the game loop of Factorio inculcates quite nicely; just as
                      Tetris addicts used to talk about closing their eyes and
                      seeing falling blocks, Factorio aficionados look up from
                      their screen and see processes that could never need
                      manual intervention again. And the game also encourages
                      people to think about scale: why automate only part of
                      your job when you could{" "}

                      As it turns out, there is a flip side to the fact that
                      some problems can be automated away: it means that, over
                      time, a larger share of the total problems in the world
                      stem from things that can't be automated away. Good luck

                      There are limitations to the Factorio mindset, which are
                      caused by the incompatibility of a full-automation mindset
                      with human nature and the typical behaviour within
                      organizations. Which makes Shopify's decision to let
                      employees expense the game a very clever one indeed: it's
                      quirky perk, partly a way for leisure time to build better
                      habits—and partly a way to give more people a shared
                      vocabulary for which business problems can be solved, and
                      how to solve them.

                      High-net-worth individuals have access to much better
                      investment strategies than those available to you. If
                      you're a serious retail investor trying to implement a
                      rule-based investing strategy, chances are you're still
                      managing your portfolio in Excel and manually entering
                      trades in a brokerage account.

                      Instead of struggling to implement strategies yourself,
                      Composer breaks the strategy creation process into
                      building blocks that can be infinitely combined using our
                      no-code visual editor. Once you create a strategy and
                      invest in it, Composer will automatically execute trades
                      on your behalf based on the strategy's logic.

                      trend: coal companies are profitable in part because so
                      many companies are withdrawing from the coal business, and
                      they happen to be leaving coal production faster than coal
                      consumption. Given the variance in demand for
                      hydrocarbons, it's hard to manage a transition well
                      without stories like this. And despite the recent
                      deviations, overall market values still point to the same
                      trend: Peabody trades at under 3x next year's earnings,
                      while NextEra, despite the recent drawdown, is trading at
                      27x—a multiple exactly ten times higher.

                        argues that based on historical trends, new home sales
                        will be at least temporarily disrupted by higher
                        mortgage prices

                      . Since homebuyers use leverage, and in fairly
                      standardized ways, the price of a house is the output of a
                      process involving down payments and monthly budgets, not
                      an input into the search process. Higher home prices, as
                      opposed to a higher monthly cost for housing, do have an
                      impact: they create more demand for construction. One
                      interesting post-Covid change is that more people at peak
                      homebuying age have relocated from cities with constrained
                      housing supply to suburbs with more willingness to build.
                      While there’s not clean data on this it's likely that the
                      correlation between housing prices and new home
                      construction is tighter than it used to be.

                      . Crypto exchanges can be a wonderfully profitable
                      business, but they're hard to expand; the cost of
                      advertising on the sites where likely crypto traders tend
                      to lurk will reflect this. Making a strategic investment
                      in a media outlet is an expensive way to grow, except
                      compared to all the other available options.

                      Why not design it right from the beginning? For two
                      reasons, relatable both to programmers and Factorio
                      players. The first reason is that you don’t necessarily
                      know what your end goal will be when you start, and it’s
                      better to build something that makes incremental progress
                      than to spend a bunch of time idly speculating about the
                      end state. The second, related reason is that the
                      resources needed to build the perfectly-designed base are
                      not available upfront, and can be acquired inefficiently
                      through a sort of rough-draft base. In CS terms, expanding
                      a poorly-specced and unmaintainable Factorio base is
                      O(log(n)) while expanding a perfectly specced one is O(n),
                      but the coefficient on the first is massively higher.

                      In the game, players have to build a factory and defend it
                      from aliens. This defense, like other parts of the game,
                      starts out with manual running-and-shooting and eventually
                      evolves into fully automated networks of laser turrets and
                      flamethrowers, all continuously refueled and repaired
                      through little eddies in the broader supply chain. The
                      biters are somewhat superfluous, since a player will
                      either a) rapidly reach a point where they're ludicrously
                      more powerful than the enemies, such that they're just a
                      minor construction checklist that never requires quick
                      executive decisions, or b) the enemies will become more
                      powerful than the player over time, which can only really
                      happen if that player is failing to automate enough. Since
                      the point of the game is to cleverly automate and scale, a
                      player who has problems with the aliens has, in a
                      spiritual sense, already lost.

                      Corporate executives often say “employees are our greatest
                      asset” or “we’re investing in talent.” This has always
                      been true figuratively: people are important, and training
                      them is worthwhile. But as talent becomes more important,
                      people will literally become assets that organizations can
                      invest in. In the process, these organizations will adopt
                      new structures that look less like corporations and more
                      like venture capital funds.

                      A key purpose of the modern corporation is to reduce
                      uncertainty. Firms hire people and own resources to ensure
                      that they will be available when needed. This approach
                      compromises dynamism for the sake of efficiency and
                      creativity for the sake of control: It helps to get known
                      things done, and it ensures someone is always available to
                      work.

                      This arrangement worked reasonably well in the industrial
                      era when companies competed by using the same resources to
                      produce the same things. The economic inputs (materials,
                      labor) were easy to quantify, the economic outputs were
                      reasonably easy to predict, efficiency was the key to
                      winning.

                      But in the 21st Century, the biggest challenge is not how
                      to get things done more efficiently; instead, the
                      challenge is figuring out what to do. And the relationship
                      between economic inputs and outputs is no longer linear.

                      Motors and early 21st Century Google. Ford knew that
                      adding an X number of employees and building Y more
                      production lines could (reasonably) predictably produce

                      Krishna Bharat would ultimately lead to the invention and

                      One of the most important companies in the history of
                      Silicon Valley was established to produce… nothing in
                      particular. As Peter Sims points out, Bill Hewlett and
                      Dave Packard set up shop in a one-car “without knowing
                      what they would eventually produce; they just knew they
                      wanted to work together and to build a great company.”
                      They came up with various electrical devices and started
                      to sell them.

                      Later, when HP was already a big company, the founders
                      maintained their open-minded approach. The company
                      innovated and grew by making what Hewlett called “small
                      bets” on products and markets that didn’t exist yet. The
                      company’s centralized management layer allocated people
                      and resources between these bets to ensure the promising
                      ones would continue to grow.

                      The HP way worked, at least for a long while. Between 1939
                      and 1999, it achieved an annual growth rate of 18%. The
                      company represented the transition from the old industrial
                      world into our own era — from the world of Ford Motor
                      Company to the world of Google and others. HP was not the
                      first company to try to come up with a new product, but
                      its approach inspired other companies in the valley,
                      including one founded by an HP intern named Steve Jobs.

                      HP officially dissolved in 2015, but its impact on the
                      future is still unfolding. In a recent interview, Marc
                      Andreessen used the term “HP 2.0” to describe his vision
                      for A16Z, one of the world’s largest venture capital
                      funds. Andreessen wants his venture firm to provide
                      portfolio companies with all the services and resources
                      that HP’s head office used to provide to its own divisions
                      and bets: money, talent, government relations, PR support,
                      marketing and distribution channels, and, more generally,
                      “someone you can call” when you suddenly need something
                      (and not just advice).

                      The convergence of corporations and venture funds is not
                      just an amusing analogy. It points to a fundamental shift

                      The original HP was a corporation that behaved a bit like
                      a venture fund: it made occasional bets. A16Z is a venture
                      fund that wants to be more like a corporation: to build a
                      relatively thick management layer that helps support its
                      multiple portfolio companies and allocate resources
                      between them.

                      Does this mean that in a few years, A16Z will look like HP
                      in its prime? No. Unlike HP, A16Z does not make a handful
                      of bets on projects it fully owns; instead, it makes
                      hundreds of bets on ventures in which it owns a minority
                      stake.

                      Is this the future of venture capital? Yes, at least
                      partly. But it is also the future of corporations as a
                      whole. The original HP was willing to compromise
                      efficiency and control for the sake of more dynamism and
                      creativity. Its founders were early to notice that the
                      world was changing and innovation was becoming more
                      important (for various reasons: globalization,
                      demographics, the emergence of consumer culture, and
                      more).

                      HP was willing to let go of some control over what its
                      various divisions did, but it still maintained full
                      ownership of them. The “little bets” were run in-house,
                      which meant the number of bets was limited.

                      Now, A16Z is realizing that innovation is becoming even
                      more important and that it’s becoming much harder to
                      figure out what to build and who to build it with (for
                      various reasons, notably the cheap cost of launching and
                      distributing software, the abundance of speculative
                      capital, the network-effects nature of many online
                      businesses, and consumers’ increasingly complex
                      preferences).

                      To succeed in such an environment, it’s no longer enough
                      to make a handful of little bets on the side. Betting is
                      becoming the main business, and an organization has to
                      make hundreds of them in order to have a decent chance to
                      succeed.

                      Of course, the word “organization” itself is less clear in
                      this context: A16Z owns pieces of hundreds of independent
                      companies, but it does not control any of them. In some
                      sense, this is not an “organization” at all. But in
                      another sense, this is a direct evolution of what HP
                      originally set out to do, but at a much larger scale. When
                      you make a handful of bets, it’s possible to maintain
                      ownership of all of them, even if you give up some
                      managerial control. But if you want to make hundreds of
                      bets, you have to give up ownership as well.

                      But this approach only solves part of the equation. It
                      increases the odds of betting on the right project or

                      Back in the bad old days when I was running Loudcloud, I
                      thought to myself: how could I have possibly prepared for
                      this? How could I know that half our customers would go
                      out of business? How could I know that it would become
                      impossible to raise money in the private markets? How
                      could I have figured out that there would be 221 IPOs in
                      2000 and 19 in 2001? Could anybody expect me to achieve a
                      reasonable outcome given those circumstances?

                      As I was feely sorry for myself, I randomly watched an
                      interview with famous football coach Bill Parcells. He was
                      telling the story of how he had a similar dilemma when he
                      began his Head Coaching career. In his very first season
                      as coach, Parcell’s team, The New York Giants, was hit
                      with a rash of injuries. He worried incessantly about the
                      impact of the injuries on the team’s fortunes, as it is
                      difficult enough to win with your best players let alone a
                      bunch of substitutes. When his friend and mentor Raiders
                      owner Al Davis called Parcells to check in, Parcells
                      relayed his injury issues. Parcell’s: “Al, I am just not
                      sure how we can win without so many of our best players.
                      What should I do?” Davis replied: “Bill, nobody cares,
                      just coach your team.”

                      That might be the best CEO advice ever. Because, you see,
                      nobody cares. When things go wrong in your company, nobody
                      cares. The press doesn’t care, your investors don’t care,
                      your board doesn’t care, your employees don’t care, even
                      your mama doesn’t care. Nobody cares.

                      And they are right not to care. A great reason for failing
                      won’t preserve one dollar for your investors, won’t save
                      one employee’s job, or get you one new customer. It
                      especially won’t make you feel one bit better when you
                      shut down your company and declare bankruptcy.

                      All the mental energy that you use to elaborate your
                      misery would be far better used trying to find the one,
                      seemingly impossible way out of your current mess. It’s
                      best to spend zero time on what you could have done and
                      all of your time on what you might do. Because in the end,
                      nobody cares, just run your company.

                      I get asked this question fairly often, and I now have a

                      Usually, people are deciding between going to college (and
                      usually working on side projects while they do so),
                      joining a company, or starting their own startup. [1] [2]

                      The secret is that any of these can be right answer, and
                      you should make your decision based on the specific
                      circumstances of each option. The critical point is that
                      you want to do the thing that is most likely to get you on
                      a path to do something great.

                      No matter what you choose, build stuff and be around smart
                      people. “Stuff” can be a lot of different things—open
                      source projects outside of class, a startup, a new sales
                      process at a company you work at—but, obviously, sitting
                      around talking with your friends about how you guys really
                      should build a website together does not count.

                      The best people always seem to be building stuff and

                      between several options, this may be a good filter.

                      Working on something good will pull you along a path where
                      good things keep happening to you. (In fact, this effect
                      is so strong that there’s a danger of getting sucked into
                      too many interesting things and getting distracted from
                      what you really want to do.)

                      In making this decision, you want to take the right kind
                      of risk. Most people think about risk the wrong way—for
                      example, staying in college seems like a non-risky path.
                      However, getting nothing done for four of your most
                      productive years is actually pretty risky. Starting a
                      company that you’re in love with is the right kind of
                      risk. Becoming employee number 50 at a company that still
                      has a good chance of failure is the wrong kind of risk.

                      If you stay in college, make sure you learn something
                      worthwhile and work on interesting projects—college is
                      probably the best place to meet people to work with. If
                      you’re really worried you’ll miss some critical social
                      experience by dropping out of college, you should probably
                      stay.

                      If you join a company, my general advice is to join a
                      company on a breakout trajectory. There are a usually a
                      handful of these at a time, and they are usually
                      identifiable to a smart young person. They are a very good
                      risk/reward tradeoff. Such a company is almost certainly
                      going to be successful, but the rest of the world isn’t
                      quite as convinced of it as they should be. Fortunately,
                      these companies love ambitious young people. In addition
                      to the equity being a great deal (you might get 1/10
                    </span>
                    <span>th</span>
                    <span>
                      {" "}
                      of the equity you’d get if you join a tiny new startup,
                      but at 1/100

                      {" "}
                      of the risk), you will work with very good people, learn
                      what success looks like, and get a W on your record (which
                      turns out to be quite valuable). Spending a few years at a
                      company that fails has path consequences, and working at
                      an already-massively-successful company means you will
                      learn much less, and probably work with less impressive
                      people.

                      Incidentally, don’t let salary be a factor. I just watched
                      someone turn down one of these breakout companies because
                      Microsoft offered him $30k per year more in salary—that
                      was a terrible decision. He will not build interesting
                      things and may not work with smart people. In a few years,
                      when it’s time for something new, the options in front of
                      him will be much worse than they could have been.

                      If you start a company, only do so if you have an idea
                      you’re in love with. If you’re hanging out with your
                      friends trying to come up with an idea, I don’t think you
                      should start that company (although there are many who
                      disagree with me). Starting a failed startup is less bad
                      than joining a failed company as an employee (and you’ll
                      certainly learn much more in the former case). If you fail
                      at an idea that you really loved and could have been
                      great, you’re unlikely to regret it, and people will not
                      hold it against you. Failing at a me-too copycat startup
                      is worse. Remember that there will be lots of other
                      opportunities to start companies, and that startups are a
                      6-10 year commitment—wait for the right one

                      One big pro for starting a company is that it’s usually
                      the way to learn the most in the shortest amount of time.
                      One big con is that it’s easy to start a company for the
                      wrong reasons—usually so that you can say you’re starting
                      a company—and this makes it easy to cloud your judgment.

                      No matter what you choose, keep your personal burn rate
                      low and minimize your commitments. I have seen a lot of
                      people miss great opportunities because they couldn’t
                      afford a reduction in salary or because they couldn’t move

                      Think about risk the right way. Drew Houston gave a great
                      commencement speech where he said you only have to be
                      right once. That’s true. The risk is not getting on the
                      path where you get to be right that one critical time.

                      option is being a VC. This is usually a mistake—the best
                      way to become a VC is not to grind your way up the ladder
                      from junior associate intern. Even if you want to be a VC,
                      you’re much better off starting or joining a startup, and
                      getting partner offers when you’re 28. Plus, good founders
                      want to work with an investor that has operational
                      experience.

                      Supreme used to create the hype we see today:

                      Supreme has mastered the art of limited supply. Since its
                      inception, Supreme has always maintained a small
                      inventory, and never released a ton of pieces. It doesn’t
                      sell in large retail stores, hence keeping its
                      availability limited. This maintained a sense of
                      authenticity , while driving up desirability and demand.
                      At this point, any other brand would’ve charged more
                      premium prices and raked in the cash.

                    <span>
                      Here’s the strategy that differentiates Supreme from the
                      herd. Instead of charging a premium price for their highly
                      desirable products, they kept them relatively cheap and
                      affordable. Now one might think this as a bad strategy, as
                      it leaves money on the table that could have easily gone
                      into Supreme’s pockets. But Supreme was able to convert
                      that foregone revenue into significant hype that led to
                      more brand equity.

                    Supreme could have easily generated a large revenue by
                    increasing either its inventory or prices, instead it
                    smartly opted for the ‘exclusivity approach’, and this has
                    worked amazingly for Supreme. With its product’s pricing as
                    high as 1200% more than the retail price on the secondary
                    resell market, Supreme has achieved the brand momentum and
                    hype that any other street wear brand could ever dream of.

                      Supreme’s website is quite different than any other
                      retailer’s website. While most of the brand devote a large
                      sum of resources to curate their online presence and and
                      need a special team that handles all the design and
                      traffic, Supreme maintains a simple, dark-themed website
                      that only shows the bare essential options for customers.
                      This ‘stripped down’ minimalist design forces all the
                      attention onto the single graphic — supreme logo which is
                      strategically placed.

                        Supreme clearly wishes to display the exclusivity of

                        not the other way around.”

                      Three days before their new drops, Supreme launches
                      ‘lookbook’ on their website that provides customers with
                      rich visual engagement with the brand. When the ‘lookbook’
                      goes live on Supreme’s site, one can see what Supreme is
                      going to drop over the next few months, but you don’t get
                      to know when those items are going to drop. Apart from
                      these, Supreme also has collaborations and surprise drops
                      which aren’t included in ‘lookbook’.

                      Also, the homepage contains a link for customers to join

                      he gets …….. NOTHING!

                      Supreme’s attention toward exclusivity also continues to
                      amaze to those who join the email list. Following suite
                      with everything else they produce, Supreme’s email sign up
                      is not the norm. While all their competitors try to
                      bombard the consumers with emails highlighting offers,
                      discounts, sales etc — Supreme uses their email list as
                      another tool to portray the message that ‘you chase us’ in
                      their marketing.

                      Supreme was started in 1994 in New York as as a reaction
                      to a slump in the skate industry. That makes it authentic,
                      or seen to be authentic. Supreme has successfully
                      infiltrated the mainstream, maintaining brand authenticity
                      and creating hype at the same time. Supreme uses various
                      unconventional strategies to approach customers and
                      leverages onto its exclusivity. With its smart
                      collaboration with different partners over the years,
                      Supreme has created brand identity and hype a typical
                      brand could ever dream of!

                      A little over a decade ago, I watched the Suite Life of
                      Zack and Cody nearly every day of the week. As a
                      seven-year-old, I was a obsessed with the show’s actors.
                      One week at school, I heard that Mr. Moseby was distantly
                      related to a classmate of mine — I took that fact as a
                      token of my own stardom.

                      little social profile to hundreds of thousands of fans.
                      They were either broadcast to the many TVs in America’s
                      home, or they were not. In this new paradigm of content
                      consumption, digital creators are the new Disney stars,
                      but there are gradations to their social fame. They can
                      see clear metrics on their growth, from 1000 followers to
                      10,000 to 100,000 (Disney stars could not). And so too can

                      and take it as a form of immense pride when they watch

                      In the era of Disney stars, the fan phenomena were
                      characterized by super fans who would, at the sight or
                      appearance of their favorite stars, yell “I am your
                      biggest fan!!.” Today, another modality of fandom has

                    conversation is digital merch. What does digital merch look
                    like? Not your avatar wearing a digital shirt. Rather: a
                    badge saying you found this person early. Being able to flex
                    to your friends that you found an artist or a content
                    creator before everyone else — and you can actually prove
                    that through your badge. It’s like the idea behind tour
                    merch — it means you were there early and a real fan. What
                    is the digital equivalent of that?” — Blake Robbins

                      However, each one of those steps, as if this moment, is
                      challenging to do. Most social platforms hold on to the
                      most important fan data points. This fact, in of itself,
                      effectively nixes steps 1 and 2.

                      A creator must reach a certain following before there is
                      the emergence of a Day One Fan. But that very fact also
                      poses the problem. Social platforms do a poor job at
                      segmenting your audience. They give you high level, not
                      granular, data. So, at 1 million followers, it is unclear
                      who the first 10,000 were.

                      I also wonder whether the emergence of the Day One fan
                      will result in increased support for up-and-coming
                      creators. If the feeling of being a Day One is a good
                      feeling, then it follows that people will put themselves
                      in circumstances that increase their likelihood of that
                      feeling coming about. I imagine a flywheel of the
                      following sort:

                      In the digital ecosystem, fans are relegated to two

                      of their favorite creators: Direct Messages (DMs) and

                      fans millions of dollars, and more.

                      Ultimately, the feeling of being a Day One is unmatched,

                      While I was at a family wedding a few weeks ago, one of my
                      aunts asked me, “So, what’s the hardest part about
                      designing a game? It must be coming up with the ideas,
                      right?”

                      I laughed. “I have plenty of ideas–hundreds of them. I
                      think most game designers do. The challenge is{" "}

                      Ever since I started Stonemaier Games–and with increasing
                      frequency–people have come to me with their ideas. Most of
                      them are board-game ideas; others are ideas for
                      Kickstarter projects in a variety of categories.

                      The sentiment is almost always the same: A person has an
                      idea, and they’re looking for help to make that idea a
                      reality. Many of them want a partner–they’ll be in charge
                      of the idea, and I’ll execute it.

                      Take, for example, pretty much any science-fiction novel,

                      So if you’re offering someone your idea in exchange for
                      them to execute it, you’re basically asking them to do
                      99.99% of the work. That’s not a partnership.

                      days researching each dish, buying the ingredients,

                      Elad Gil didn’t grow up in Silicon Valley. The son of a
                      nurse and an academic studying education psychology, he
                      grew up akin to a military brat, moving between Michigan,
                      San Diego, Israel, and Arizona in his early years.

                      But he seems to have a golden touch when picking startups
                      that turn into unicorns or decacorns. Gil, who typically
                      makes bets in seed-stage companies, has cut checks to some
                      25 startups that have since reached the vaunted unicorn
                      status, including Instacart, Stripe, and Coinbase.

                      While many individual investors are considered angels that

                      often cited as a part of trend dubbed "solo capitalists"—a

                      later stages and compete with traditional venture capital

                      I was getting a Ph.D in biology—focused on human
                      diseases-related areas, for example virology, cancer,
                      aging—and I realized partway through that I didn’t want to
                      become an academic, partly because you get thrown into a
                      lab for a long time. I was thinking through what is the
                      biggest way to have an impact and do something useful for
                      people.

                      At the same time, I was interested in technology. I think
                      we forget today how hard it was to do so many things: When
                      I was in high school, I mailed random mathematicians
                      because I was really interested what they were doing, and
                      they would then send back those yellow envelopes with
                      print outs of their papers. Now, oh my gosh, suddenly any
                      kid can go online and read every single mathematics paper
                      that is relevant in the world.

                      have an old Silicon Valley ethos of wanting to do useful
                      things for people and to impact the world
                      positively—unfortunately that’s become the type of thing

                      I think the biggest determinant of success tends to be the
                      market. I’ve seen really, really good teams in terrible
                      markets get completely crushed. I’ve also seen really bad
                      teams in good markets do really well. So first and
                      foremost, I care about if you’re building something
                      interesting in a market that is large enough.

                      It’s pretty rare for me to invest in a team without an
                      idea—usually I wait until people are working on something
                      specific so it's easier to validate whether that market
                      makes sense. Sometimes you see teams that have built the
                      same thing over and over again in their career for
                      different companies, and they decide to build it as a
                      piece of infrastructure, like PagerDuty.

                      non-obvious markets. People may think it's toyish, or
                      dumb, or super low-end—so often things start off looking
                      weird, and you [as an investor], may wonder, “Why would
                      you really want to do that?” And you need a bit of
                      convincing.

                      I invested in Airbnb, I think, when it was just eight
                      people, and they were still working out of Brian Chesky’s
                      apartment at the time. I knew them previously, and they
                      pinged me while raising their Series A. It actually seemed
                      like a really good concept and idea.

                      beginning to work on their side. And before that, when I

                      , a service born out of the Esperanto community in World
                      War II. Their basic belief was that if you could stay with
                      people in a foreign country and learn about them directly
                      and vice versa, we would be more likely to have world
                      peace. So you’d sign up for the service and they’d
                      interview you and make sure you weren’t crazy or anything.
                      Then you’d visit a country and they’d give you a printed
                      booklet with the names of all the people that would host
                      you for free in that country—with rules, of course, around
                      needing to contact them a week or a night ahead. So you
                      could literally show up in Rome with this booklet and just
                      call or email anyone in it to stay with them.

                      Founders are really important. Beyond signals like
                      perseverance, grit, and ethics, you ask: Are people
                      learning rapidly? Are they good at sales? Not only can
                      they sell to new customers, but also can they convince
                      people to join them and can they raise money? You need at
                      least one part of the founding team to be good at selling,
                      and one part to be good at building, and later in life of
                      the company, you need someone who is good at tight
                      operations.

                      What people now call "solo capitalists" actually has a

                      One shift is that companies have stayed private for much
                      longer. Now companies take 8 to 12 years to go public, but
                      founders could still use help from operator investors,
                      which many solo capitalist are, as their companies are
                      scaling and going into growth spurts—which is often when
                      everything is starting to break at a company.

                      I also think this is a trend because there’s been a sudden
                      shift in which networks are really important. I feel like
                      this happens every five years or so. Some networks that
                      were relevant before are still relevant today, like
                      Y-Combinator or Google. But there are a bunch of companies
                      that aren’t as relevant anymore and are being replaced by,
                      say, Stripe—which is a really important founding
                      network—or Opendoor, Coinbase, Uber, etc. There are more
                      and more founders [and investors] emerging from these next
                      waves of companies.

                      great engineers, hasn’t created a whole lot of startups in
                      the last twenty years. There are many interesting
                      companies up there, but it’s not reflective of the fact
                      that Amazon and Microsoft are anchor companies.

                      There are sometimes small companies that have spawned half
                      a dozen interesting companies and other dynamics. Look at
                      the PayPal network: Every single company founded by
                      someone ex-PayPal that hit scale was founded by a former
                      executive. For some reason, the executive team at PayPal
                      was amazing at starting these massive, important
                      companies, but the rank-and-file employees, with the big
                      exception of YouTube, didn't start much. Why is that? It
                      could be the culture, the decision-making, the people they
                      attract—I have no idea why. There are really strange
                      dynamics that I don’t really understand but I think are
                      fascinating to think about.

                      I think, fundamentally, it is up to the founder and/or CEO
                      of the company to determine what they want the employees
                      of their company to focus on from a mission-driven
                      perspective. And it is really up to the founders, really
                      early on in the life of the company, to define that
                      mission, and to some extent you define that mission over
                      time. Each CEO has it within their purview to define the
                      focus and mission of the company. And if people want to
                      have a broad mission for their company, they can define it
                      that way. And if they want to have a very narrow mission
                      for their company, they can define it that way too.

                      About a year ago, I read a blog post about interesting
                      things that should happen in the social-media world.
                      Number one, there was a technology shift—so WebRTC and
                      WebGL were baked into the browser—and WebRTC allowed for
                      really crisp audio and video that you can build really
                      great video apps on.

                      Secondly, you have a generational shift. People don’t want
                      to use their parents' social network, and I think in five
                      to eight years, there will be turnover on certain networks
                      and I think we are ripe for one. And now with COVID,
                      people crave social interactions so you have more room for
                      experimentation and adoption.

                      it. So I’ve been scouring obscure parts of the webs and
                      playing with them. I think there are finally things
                      happening with, say, in-browser VR—but again, it’s very

                      Oh, a bunch. I missed Lyft. I was a little worried about
                      the valuation at the time and competition with Uber. At
                      the time there was a really strong perception that every
                      strong technology market would be winner-takes-all when in
                      reality, many markets are oligopoly markets. I just
                      misunderstood the market structure and the valuation.

                      Speculation is taking a bet on yourself, on someone, or
                      something that others aren't willing to take. Speculation
                      doesn't mean a bunch of traders in a closed room moving
                      money around. Speculation is an artist backing themselves,
                      funding a scientist's experiments, a community coming
                      together to create a city, or a developer building
                      something that might not work. Speculation at its best is
                      about furthering humanity, it is one of our superpowers.
                      But with that power comes responsibility.

                      It's also worth calling out the difference between
                      gambling and speculation. Gambling is zero-sum—when you
                      win, someone is losing. Gambling is also speculation for
                      speculation's sake. Betting on a game isn't pushing
                      society forward, betting on someone or a project might.
                      Speculation is positive-sum, if you win, many others
                      might, and society will have progressed as a result.

                      So while we see the endless "number go up" and seemingly
                      everyone on Twitter getting rich across crypto and
                      NFTs—it's always good to remember why we're speculating in
                      the first place. Otherwise, it's too easy to get lost in
                      the charts, percentages, the FOMO, and the never-ending
                      tweet celebrations. We'll be left with empty heads, empty
                      wallets, empty souls, and nothing to show for it.

                      At the outset, these securities seemed like a safe
                      investment. Bowie's songs were played regularly on the
                      radio, and his albums were selling well, even decades
                      after they were published. Royalties from his work
                      generated a steady income stream that was likely to
                      continue. Bowie Bonds received a triple-A rating from
                      Moodys, indicating they were as safe as U.S. government
                      bonds.

                      album sales declined, and the bonds started to trade at a
                      discount. Bondholders were looking to sell them, expecting
                      a further deterioration in the underlying income stream's
                      quality. In 2004, Moodys{" "}

                      somewhat thanks to the emergence of new, legal ways to
                      listen and pay for music online. In 2007, the original

                      Bowie was not naive. He didn't issue the bonds because he
                      thought his income would remain stable. Being a rockstar
                      was a precarious existence, to begin with. But Bowie

                      Issuing the bonds was a way to share his risks with people
                      who were more optimistic about the future of online media

                      in new ways to make money from music, assuming that the
                      old ways would soon be irrelevant.

                      any other type of content and many goods and services. On
                      the internet, every individual has the power to become a
                      star — to reach every person on earth. And a growing
                      number of individuals face the anxiety that was previously
                      exclusive to rockstars: the fear that whatever works today
                      is just a fad and that someone or something will shortly
                      come along and make you obsolete or expose you as a fraud.

                      But technology does not only democratize risk. It also
                      introduces new ways to share and mitigate it. Back in
                      1997, Bowie had to work with investment bankers, rating
                      agencies, and insurance giants to issue and sell his
                      bonds. It was an expensive and time-consuming process that
                      only a wealthy, established artist could pull off. Today,
                      anyone can sell a piece of their future earnings to pay
                      for their present lifestyle. One way to do so is via

                      If the skills end up being useless, the school will not
                      get paid. This is true even if the student ends up earning

                      you are working in a 'Qualified Position' [which means]
                      any role in any field where your participation in Lambda

                      The $ALEX story sounds frivolous, but it allowed a young
                      man from France to finance a trip to Silicon Valley and
                      enabled him to share the risk of building an independent
                      career. Unlike David Bowie, Alex Masmej was not a
                      celebrity and did not employ bankers. He used open-source
                      technology — the Ethereum blockchain — to create a
                      financial derivative that anyone on earth could buy.

                    "Creator coins are a new type of asset class that is tied to
                    the reputation of an individual, rather than to a company or
                    commodity. They are truly the first tool we have as a
                    society to trade "social clout" as an asset. If people
                    understand this, then the value of someone's coin should be
                    correlated to that person's standing in society.

                      Beyond pure speculation, fans can use the coins to deepen
                      their relationship with creators. A celebrity can set up
                      an inbox that only coin-owners can send messages to. Or
                      let fans bid for the celebrity to mention their name on an
                      Instagram or Twitter post.

                      By letting your fans own a "piece of you," you also
                      incentivize them to support your continued success. If you
                      own an Elon Musk Coin, it will make sense for you to
                      promote Mr. Musk and try to get other people to buy his
                      coins. By increasing demand for the coins you already own,
                      you can become wealthier. And those who buy the coins
                      after you will continue to convince others. And as long as
                      the story is convincing and there are enough new people to
                      convince — the coins will go up in value.

                      Celebrities are lucky to be able to make money in this
                      way. But they also have no choice — being a star is a
                      precarious existence, riddled with anxiety. And this
                      anxiety and precariousness are no longer exclusive to

                      Alex Mesmaj's experiment was unique when it happened. But
                      today, any person can easily issue their own token and let
                      other people trade it. And when more occupations become
                      scalable, even the most succesful professionals are facing

                      The best way to handle the risks and uncertainty of
                      scalable occupations is to share them. Doctors or fitness
                      instructors or writers or investment advisors worried
                      about the future can issue tokens and let their fans and
                      customers participate in their careers' ups and downs.

                      And just like with celebrities, sharing risk is only part
                      of the story. By letting other people invest in you, you
                      are incentivizing them to promote your own story and do
                      their best to increase your tokens' value.

                      In such a scenario, every career becomes a pyramid scheme.
                      If you can attract enough people to buy your tokens, and
                      they can attract enough people to buy even more tokens,
                      the whole enterprise will continue to increase in value.
                      This increase will happen regardless of how much revenue

                      It connects everyone to everyone. So, the internet is an

                      which could be just the weirdest thing. It could be like
                      people who collect snakes, to like people who like to ride

                      someone who’s obsessed with miniature cooking. Like,
                      there’s this whole Japanese miniature cooking phenomenon.
                      Or there’s a show about a woman who goes in people’s

                      other, that can substitute for each other.

                      like Nivi. And I get the same feelings, and the same

                      different interests, different obsessions. And it’s that
                      diversity that becomes a creative superpower. So, each

                      times the distribution of the top cable news networks.
                      Just on his news channel. It’s not even on his
                      entertainment channel.

                      Basically, when you’re competing with people it’s because
                      you’re copying them. It’s because you’re trying to do the
                      same thing. But every human is different. Don’t copy.

                      I know we’re mimetic creatures, and René Girard has a
                      whole mimesis theory. But it’s much easier than that.
                      Don’t imitate. Don’t copy. Just do your own thing. No one
                      can compete with you on being you. It’s that simple.
                    </span>

                    <span>
                      And so the more authentic you are to who you are, and what
                      you love to do, the less competition you’re gonna have.
                      So, you can escape competition through authenticity when
                      you realize that no one can compete with you on being you.
                      And normally that would have been useless advice
                      pre-internet. Post-internet you can turn that into a
                      career.

                        productivity we have to understand the things that lie
                        below it: psychology, neuroscience, literature, and
                        philosophy. In essence, to look at productivity is to
                        look at the human experience. How our brains and bodies
                        work, and how they can move us closer or further away
                        from what we value.

                      Just over a year ago, I was hit with my first and
                      nasty—and I mean nasty—wave of depression. I made it
                      thirty-two whole years without experiencing a crushing
                      inability to get out of bed or a persistent lump in the
                      back of the throat and it was terrifying to find myself
                      facing some very big, and very scary feelings without any
                      familiarity, experience, or tools to deal with them.

                      I’m on the other side of it now. And, from this admittedly
                      fortunate position, I can say with confidence that I’m
                      grateful I went through it. Having my back against the
                      wall forced me to understand more about what makes me
                      tick, shuts me down, and picks me up. And it forced me to
                      make some big changes in my life to get acquainted with
                      and comfortable accommodating them. I wish I had done a
                      lot of this work sooner.

                      Given what I now intimately understand about depression,
                      it feels strange to write those words and even stranger to
                      publish them where anyone might encounter them. Depression
                      is awful. I don’t wish it on anyone. I know not everyone
                      finds their way out and that those who do have walked many
                      different paths to get there.

                      I’m going to share more about the path I walked, and what

                      only one person with one set of experiences and one body
                      with one brain and one endocrine system governing it all.
                      But maybe, just maybe, someone else will find what I tried
                      and learned useful. And maybe, just maybe, someone

                      My depression came on a few months into the pandemic when
                      the uncertainty of it all was at its height. I had just
                      broken up with my boyfriend of five years and was living
                      alone for the first time. The solitude was taking its
                      toll. Friends and family were feeling further away every
                      day. People I loved and respected were recommending books
                      and movies they were sure I’d enjoy from my couch, but
                      nothing could hold my attention. My inner world felt
                      completely topsy-turvy.

                      It didn’t take long for my outward behavior to start
                      reflecting that chaotic feeling inside. Seemingly out of
                      nowhere, I would suddenly have to turn my camera off in
                      meetings. I would flake on plans and eject from phone
                      calls without warning. You can imagine what havoc this
                      would wrap on my life, my work, and my relationships. This
                      kickstarted what turned into a cycle of guilt, anxiety,
                      instability, shame, and frustration. But, I just kept
                      plodding along like nothing was happening.

                      It took me choking up in response to a cheery woman on the
                      other end of a customer support line asking “how can I
                      help you?” for me to consider that things might be more
                      than a little off. I ended up hanging up after she asked
                      for my order confirmation because the thought of opening
                      up my inbox at that particular moment felt too
                      overwhelming. One time I was out for a run in Marin and I
                      had to sit down in the middle of the trail. It was more
                      than 30 minutes before I was able to stand back up. Not
                      long after that, I found myself in my garage with the
                      ignition on hesitating to open the garage door. That
                      scared me. Enough to know I needed to intervene.

                      By this time, I barely recognized myself. I felt like I
                      had become an entirely different person who I had no
                      familiarity with. So, I decided to study her. The hope was
                      that by getting better acquainted with the nature of these
                      new feelings, and the person embodying them, I could
                      better manage them all—avoid the triggers, run towards the
                      good stuff, and maybe even more.

                      I cannot say with any certainty what compelled me to
                      pursue this direction. One hypothesis is that I’m
                      naturally a relatively obsessive documenter. I’ve always
                      felt at home in trackers and dashboards and metrics and
                      lists and everything in between (I expect this might
                      resonate with many readers of this particular
                      publication). Another hypothesis is that I was desperate
                      to create some semblance of order and control in my life.
                      I definitely could not control the dizzying waves of
                      sadness washing over me, but I knew that I could create a
                      kick-ass tracker to help me get smarter about them.

                      I also think it’s relevant that I was already coming from
                      a place of wanting to bring more self-inquiry into my
                      life. I had been in therapy for about a year at this point
                      and was starting to see glimmers of the benefits. Having a
                      professional on the case and in my corner was not a silver
                      bullet by any means, but it was a meaningful safety net.
                      Even outside of the scope of my depression, working with a
                      good therapist whom I trust has had the most influence on
                      my overall happiness of anything I’ve done in my life. It
                      is an enormous privilege to have the time and money to
                      spend on it.

                      So, alongside my work in therapy, I committed to a month
                      of tracking my moods on both a proactive and reactive
                      basis (though three weeks turned out to be enough).

                      logged the intensity of my sadness on a five-point scale
                      and recorded the time, place, what I was doing, who I was
                      doing it with, what was on my mind, and anything else that
                      felt relevant. (I landed on five because I wanted to
                      capture sufficient nuance without diluting the data.) I
                      also made sure to log what I was doing in the hour before
                      bed and in the hour after I woke up every day. My morning
                      log always included a best estimate of how much sleep I
                      got according to my Apple Watch. Over time I also included
                      my own impressions of sleep quality (ie. how tired did I
                      feel when I woke up?).

                      (screenshots below) to log my moods. Of all the apps, I
                      like this one best because I like the words it employs to
                      capture the nuance of how I was feeling (versus a simpler
                      rating scale). One cool thing about the app is that it
                      also asks you if you want to maintain or shift your mood.
                      This became a helpful data point.

                      It sounds like a lot of work, and it was, but here are the
                      kinds of insights I gleaned over those three weeks. They
                      are very specific to me, but I thought it might be helpful
                      to share the kind of stuff I was able to learn about
                      myself. Most of it wasn’t obvious before I started all
                      this tracking. And, many of these things remain true in my
                      healthier place.

                      In hindsight, it’s pretty surprising that I was able to
                      keep the tracking up despite feeling so unmotivated and
                      overwhelmed in other areas of my life. I think what kept
                      me going was having one space, however small, where I made
                      all the rules and controlled all the outcomes. While
                      everything else made me feel helpless and powerless, my

                      The insights about my moods inspired another experiment.
                      The goal of this one was to determine whether any activity
                      would make a good day more likely. Or better yet,
                      guarantee one. After doing a bit of research with friends
                      and on the internet, I sat down and made a list of Good
                      Day Cheat Code candidates.

                      I committed to doing the activity for three days in a row
                      before evaluating its candidacy. I relied on a combination
                      of data from my mood trackers and my anecdotal feeling to
                      evaluate whether something improved my day or not. I also
                      tracked the activation energy required to do the thing as
                      a proxy for how likely I was to actually do it.

                      I’ll admit to running a very shoddy experiment. A
                      reasonable person would say that I didn’t have a real
                      baseline/control group, or experiment over enough time,
                      and that correlation and causation would be completely
                      indistinguishable. But I wanted insights fast, and whether
                      they were real or imagined, I figured it probably wasn’t
                      going to hurt. And plus, all the tracking was still
                      helping me access itty bitty flashes of warm-and-fuzzy
                      feelings.

                      was around a couple of close friendships. The details feel
                      too private to share and would probably be boring anyway,
                      but through careful observation and introspection, I
                      learned that I would have to take time away from those
                      friends in order to properly heal.

                      I also want to acknowledge the role financial security
                      played in my recovery, specifically with regard to my
                      ability to step away from work when I felt I had to.
                      During this time, I was able to fully prioritize my mental
                      health over everything else. This means that I could focus
                      on my well-being without worrying about the financial
                      impact of my strategies or coping mechanisms. I am
                      tremendously privileged to have this option and I know
                      that it is not available to everyone, or even most people.
                      This includes therapy. I have to be honest that I’m not
                      sure I would have been able to realize the full benefits
                      of all this work so quickly, or maybe even at all, without
                      it.

                      Still, these were extremely difficult decisions and
                      conversations. I was terrified of further distancing
                      myself from my community at a time that I was already
                      feeling so isolated. I was terrified of doing irreparable
                      damage to my professional reputation. If I felt like I
                      could squeak by without taking these
                      objectively-harmful-to-people-I-loved-and-respected
                      actions, I would have. But I knew I had to prioritize my
                      recovery and that these were decisive steps in a direction
                      I needed to go. And, as a Good Metrics-Driven
                      Decision-Maker™, I had high confidence in taking these
                      specific steps.

                      Initially, the Post-Its had very basic tasks like ‘shower’
                      or ‘brush teeth’ or ‘go outside.’ In low moments, I could
                      go to the wall and pick something and do it immediately to
                      feel a little better—something about not only doing the
                      action, but also moving something above the line felt
                      really good. Even at the time I was aware that it was a
                      low form of “productivity,” but it was forward progress
                      nonetheless. And at that time, small moves and a little
                      momentum made a huge difference.

                      Over time, I got more and more Post-Its over the line more
                      and more consistently. I introduced more substantive and
                      increasingly engaging tasks like hiking, writing, reading,
                      or cooking. After about a month, I was able to go onto a
                      weekly cadence, which is what you see a picture of below.

                      Eventually, I was able to ditch the Post-Its altogether.
                      There are, of course, still little bumps and paper cuts in
                      my life, but they don’t rattle me as much. Now that I know
                      what it’s like to have none, I don’t take my happiness for
                      granted, which ironically makes me happier. On top of
                      that, I acquired many tools for dealing with low moments
                      of any shape and size and maximizing the happiness and
                      satisfaction in my life.

                      On the work side of things, I started doing some research
                      on a topic that I’ve always been interested in simply
                      because learning about it{" "}

                      projects. And that turned into a capital J Job that I

                      looks like I might just get to. In my relationships, most
                      of my friendships are back on track, primarily due to
                      these particular friends being exceedingly and maybe even
                      unreasonably empathetic and kind. Some friendships are not
                      as accepting of change, but I’m at peace with that—I have
                      a new friendship with myself. I know how to cook a few
                      more things and found some incredible running and biking
                      routes across the Bay Area that I still frequent. I’m back
                      to reading and writing a ton and my gusto for TV has been
                      reignited. And on top of all of that good stuff, I’ve also
                      fallen in love.

                      I really want to end things here—a happy ending! But the
                      words are feeling strange again. I wrote this piece to
                      provide a structure for self-discovery. I wrote it with
                      the hope that it might help someone in a dark place find
                      optimism. Like any well-trained operator, I provided clear
                      tactics and linear steps. Like a good storyteller, I gave
                      you a beginning, middle, and end. But the truth is, there
                      is no stopping point when it comes to mental health. I can
                      still feel the depression lurking. And while this
                      particular section of my narrative may end with a life
                      built back up, I am acutely aware that depression mainly
                      serves to break a person down. And that its most powerful
                      and pernicious feature is that it can shift shapes in such
                      a way that allows it to find anyone, anywhere, at any
                      time.

                      The greatest trick the office ever pulled was convincing
                      people it doesn't exist. Even before Covid, offices were
                      trying hard to pretend they were homes or social spaces —
                      and corporations were trying to pretend they were families
                      or communities.

                      These trends will intensify. Remote work makes the office
                      even less visible. And flexible work makes the boundaries
                      of the corporation less distinct.

                      But change does not stop there. It is not just where or
                      when we work that is changing; it is the nature of work
                      itself. For a growing number of people, work is becoming
                      indistinguishable from leisure. In some cases, the workers
                      don't even know they are working. In others, workers think
                      they are working while they are, in fact, resting.

                      In the emerging world of work, video gamers are getting
                      paid to play games, and fans are paid to listen to music.
                      This is not charity. People are paid to consume, like, and
                      share because their actions contribute to the economy. In
                      some cases, their "efforts" provide essential feedback
                      that helps products and algorithms improve. In other
                      cases, their initial support helps increase the odds a
                      specific product will succeed. And in other cases, their
                      presence makes the game (or event, or group chat) more
                      exciting for customers who actually pay.

                      In some cases, this arrangement is explicit. People are
                      literally paid to play games. In most cases, this

                      and, by doing so, generate revenue for corporations that

                      economy in which the right inputs are very likely to
                      produce the right outputs. Instead, we are in an economy
                      in which the right inputs are just table stakes; they are
                      a lottery ticket. But the right outputs — the things that
                      become successful — are those that happen to draw the
                      attention of the crowd at the right moment and, in turn,
                      are boosted by algorithms that turn initial success into
                      ultimate, absolute success.

                      In some industries, companies deal with this uncertainty
                      by avoiding any attempt at innovation. This is the reason
                      why the most successful movies of the 21st Century are
                      remakes or extensions of earlier, already-successful
                      movies. Trying something new is too risky. As long as it
                      is viable, recycling remains the most logical strategy.
                      But it is not always viable. And in other industries,
                      companies must make multiple bets in order to have a
                      fighting chance.

                      In such industries, the employees themselves are bets.
                      Corporations hire tens of thousands of equally qualified
                      people with the hope that one or a handful of them will
                      come up with an idea that makes it all worthwhile. These
                      companies are not recycling ideas, but they are recycling
                      capital. They are using billions made from past successes
                      to bet on employees who will maybe develop a future
                      success that will help finance even more bets. This
                      dynamic is painfully visible in companies like Google,
                      Facebook, and Apple, who are hoarding a huge chunk of the
                      world's talent — throwing people and ideas at the wall to
                      see what sticks.

                      In such a world, it is no longer possible to do nothing.
                      Every activity — playing a game, watching a video,
                      building a product, or even just staying alive —
                      contributes directly to one endeavor or another. Every
                      human act is an act of allocating capital. In such a
                      world, "fun" will become a more productive activity in the
                      narrow economic sense. But leisure itself will become
                      obsolete. Simply being useless will no longer be possible.

                      I have always struggled with one thought. The kind of
                      recurring thought that never really leaves you: “It’s too
                      late.” Too late to publish a book, too late to start a
                      company, too late to learn a new language. This is called
                      time anxiety. The number of skills I haven’t acquired and
                      the opportunities I didn’t take because of that very
                      thought are, frankly, infuriating. It’s only recently that
                      I have managed to get over that thought, and, while in my
                      case it is still a daily struggle, I wanted to share some
                      of my strategies.

                      And when society tells us—or when we interpret signs from
                      society as saying—that it’s too late to achieve a
                      particular goal, we don’t perceive it as meaningful
                      enough. We need—we demand—that what we do with our lives

                      Time anxiety does not necessarily mean that you believe in
                      an outside force that has assigned a purpose to your life,
                      and that you are yet to discover. It just means that your

                      importance of the value you feel you are creating with

                      , it’s important to accept a few truths to be able to feel
                      in control of your daily time and your lifetime. First,
                      time exists and we can’t change that. Time will move
                      forward, and so will we. Accepting these simple yet
                      daunting truths is the first step in reducing time
                      anxiety. Next, you can start implementing some strategies.

                    trying to excavate down to our most rudimentary ambition—a
                    time-worn exercise—we’ll eventually find all reasons lead to
                    the same place, to the one core reason for living we’d
                    sought all along, the core reason against which we measure
                    the value of everything we do: to be happy.”

                      , spending too much mental energy on finding it rather
                      than doing things that make us happy can be
                      anxiety-inducing. Here are three steps you can take to
                      reduce time anxiety while still finding meaning in your
                      day-to-day life:

                      , without overthinking about how feasible the final
                      outcome would be. Just think of your output and how it
                      makes you feel to work on producing it. For example, don’t
                      think about happy it would make you to publish a book. Ask
                      yourself if you really enjoy writing. Don’t think about
                      how proud you would be to run a marathon. Question whether
                      you like running. Create a short list of activities you
                      really enjoy and that bring value to yourself or to the
                      world.

                      this does not mean making time for them. Instead, think of
                      where you will incorporate these moments into your life.
                      Maybe on your way to work. Maybe at home, after the kids
                      are asleep. Or maybe spending time with your kids is the
                      activity you want to make space for. If you happen to have
                      less time than expected, that’s completely fine. It’s more
                      about designing a space dedicated to your “time well
                      spent” activities. As the prolific writer Maria Edgeworth
                      said, “If we take care of the moments, the years will take
                      care of themselves.”

                      with, and may keep on struggling with for the rest of my
                      life. If that’s something you’re also struggling with, I

                      In March, I went to Epic’s headquarters in Cary, North
                      Carolina to speak to Epic CEO Tim Sweeney about those new
                      tools, and about the metaverse of the future. This
                      interview has been lightly edited for clarity and length.

                        Are we reaching a stage where graphics technology can
                        build worlds that are so lifelike that they can spill
                        out of games and be used as realistic simulations of
                        things we’d normally do in person?

                      That’s exactly what’s happening, and it’s making possible
                      this phenomena they talked about in the 1990s, of{" "}

                    <span>
                      . Remember that? Like CD-ROMs and multimedia? The idea
                      pitched back then was that you would have the same kinds
                      of media capabilities across film and games, and that they
                      would come together into a single industry that had the
                      best of both worlds. It took 25 years extra, but we’re
                      actually there now, and convergence is happening because
                      you’re able to use the same sort of high-fidelity graphics
                      on a movie set and in a video game. And in architectural
                      visualization and automotive design, you can actually
                      build all of these 3D objects–both a virtual twin to every
                      object in the world, or every object in your company or in
                      your movie. And then you can use all of those same assets
                      across many different forms of media.

                      together on the basis of respecting their mutual customer

                      those relationships. And there’s a healthy competition for

                      So yeah, the metaverse is the intersection of everybody’s
                      ecosystem, kind of like back in the early history of the
                      internet. In the early 1980s, you had a lot of different
                      research universities and companies with their own local
                      area networks. They’re all separate from each other, and
                      somebody realized, well, we could run some cables between
                      them all across the nation, and the internet came from
                      that. Then they realized we need to connect our email
                      systems, and so at some point somebody invented that
                      address system where if you were employed at X and your
                      name was X, that would be your email address. They put the
                      @ into email addresses.

                      Being able to connect all of these different ecosystems
                      together into an internet of ecosystems, or a metaverse of
                      ecosystems, is one of the critical steps. We don’t want a
                      dozen companies to fight each other to create the one
                      monopoly that rules them all, and one wins and now
                      everybody is locked into their proprietary thing. We want
                      to work with all of the companies to help build one open
                      system that arises over the next decade. Every year, we
                      want more of it. It’s not going to magically appear all at
                      once, because it’s monstrously complicated. Every year, we
                      want to get closer and closer to this connected ideal,
                      where every company can participate.

                      Epic does. We’re doing more and more of this all the time.
                      I think Roblox is also another really good-spirited
                      company. You know, after IPO-ing and facing enormous
                      investor expectations, they took their scripting language
                      that powers all of Roblox and they released it,
                      permissively licensed, open source, so any game developer
                      can decide to use that. It’s quite an incredible move
                      toward openness.

                      You have Microsoft adopting Linux and making long-term
                      commitments to partners and the world about the openness
                      of their Microsoft Store and how they will not use the
                      tying practices Apple uses. I think you can find a good
                      enough set of companies that are all willing to work
                      together on this. And I think even for the companies that
                      currently aren’t, they’ll be going through generational
                      changes in which the next generation of leadership might
                      actually take a completely different view of the world.
                      And then it’s blue skies ahead.

                      This larger ecosystem, the metaverse, is going to arise
                      from a lot of different things coming together over time.
                      One of them is going to be massive groups of players and
                      their friends, which are represented in social graphs.
                      Epic has one with 600 million accounts and 4.7 billion
                      social connections. Microsoft has a huge one with Xbox
                      Live, and PlayStation has one, and Nintendo has one, and
                      Steam has one. We’d really like to work with other

                        talking about a decentralization. Since decentralization

                      There are some great ideas and principles driving that
                      work. The idea of a digital economy that’s not gate-kept
                      by any one company, which is decentralized and open to all
                      participants and has incredibly low transaction fees,
                      that’s an awesome aspiration. I support the idea of
                      universal ownership–the idea that if you were to buy an
                      avatar in one place that you’d own it in every other place
                      where it’s conceptually compatible. That’s an awesome
                      idea. I think there’s a lot of incredibly interesting
                      technology foundation work being done there. The field of
                      zero knowledge proofs–the idea that you can verify that
                      something happened without receiving any private details
                      about it–that powers a number of the cryptocurrencies in
                      protecting privacy while running a decentralized system, I
                      think that’s going to be the backbone of a large part of
                      the next century in technology.

                      But, unfortunately right now it’s bundled up with a lot of
                      speculation and a lot of outright scams, and a lot of
                      efforts are scammy by construction in that the thing
                      they’re pursuing doesn’t achieve a plausible version of
                      the stated goals. You know, like the blockchain avatar
                      economies for example, there are a bunch of companies
                      aspiring to make avatars that you universally own, but
                      none of them I’ve found, not a single one, has actually
                      made any effort to foster actual adoption of these avatars
                      by any actual games or ecosystems. They just want to build
                      this thing and sell people avatars, but they’re completely
                      useless in practice.

                      I firmly believe there’s going to be a multi-trillion
                      dollar economy around digital goods in the future. But I
                      think so much of the crypto currency effort, especially
                      touching the gaming space, doesn’t address that problem of
                      utility. They’re showing you digital goods you can’t do
                      anything with except to say that you own it. You can
                      cryptographically prove that you own it, but who cares?

                      I think these are both incredibly important facets of the
                      metaverse. The metaverse is going to have purely digital
                      manifestations, places that don’t exist in the real world.
                      If you want to go up to a space station or another planet,
                      that’s going to be purely digital. And there will be
                      real-world manifestations, too, which integrate virtual
                      overlays on top of it, like Pokémon Go does. Imagine the
                      entire world being a beehive of different activity. In
                      some places, there are Pokemons running around. In some
                      places, there are other game assets. And [there are]
                      protocols for disambiguating what should be there at any
                      time. And that’s going to be massive.

                      And I think there’s a lot of magic to be had by converging
                      both parts of this, so sometimes you’re in the physical
                      world with virtual enhancements and sometimes you’re in
                      the purely virtual world. And the economy is going to be
                      highly linked. Every maker of fashion products of all
                      sorts would like that in the future when you buy the
                      physical clothing you own it in the metaverse. And when
                      you’re in the metaverse, to see some cool item of clothing
                      and buy it and own it both digitally and physically, and
                      it will be a way better way to find new clothing. Looking
                      at photos of it in low resolution on Amazon.com isn’t that
                      great compared to seeing how it flows in a physics system,
                      simulating cloth and your character.

                      I think it’s really interesting. We’re releasing this
                      engine [Unreal Engine 5] with a bunch of code and a bunch
                      of tools, but it’s really exciting to probe what it does
                      for the world–what really happens as a result of this and
                      how it fits into the bigger picture. It’s a shame that the
                      metaverse is so over-hyped right now. There’s all this gas
                      and blockchain and this, but you add up the users and we
                      found [there are] about 600 million people playing
                      metaverse types of experiences socially with their
                      friends.

                      I think it’s like 1999 [part] two and [there’s] going to
                      be some reckoning with reality for the companies that are
                      building things that don’t quite or don’t really work. But
                      it’s also a renaissance. When the foundations for the
                      future are actually being built right now.

                      It is often argued that the progressive release of quests
                      alleviates this by providing faster progression for a late
                      player, but IMO this is not a perfect solution: Even if
                      more quests are available and can be completed in
                      parallel, buying a trimestral pass in the last week will
                      require massive engagement, and involves a higher risk for
                      the player.

                      In Fortnite and Brawl Stars (among many other games),
                      players can choose between the regular premium Pass or a
                      kickstarted alternative that grants a lot of rewards right
                      away and skips a bunch of menial tasks, allowing the
                      player to focus on the juicy rewards.

                      . In my experience, skips account for a very little part
                      of the revenue of the Pass, so they can be considered just
                      a minor sink at best. Making Tier Skips more attractive
                      would require adding more grinding to acquiring rewards,
                      which would damage the overall value of the Pass and
                      generate frustration (many players not completing the
                      entire Pass or having to make additional purchases to get
                      enough value would make them choose not to buy it again).

                      Re-rolls can be particularly useful in games where Pass
                      tasks are very focused on the horizontal expansion (i.e.
                      require to play a specific mode or character the player
                      hasn’t mastered or dislikes), but ultimately same as the
                      Tier Skips, they generally don’t tend to generate a lot of
                      revenue and act as a minor sink. Frustrating players with
                      quests they don’t want to do is not a good way to
                      incentivize them to buy the Pass.

                      In Brawl Stars, rerolls can be very useful as they allow
                      the player to skip quests focusing on Brawlers or modes
                      they don’t want to focus on. But instead of selling them
                      directly, they are used as an extra incentive to buy the
                      premium Pass.

                      . Another way to increase Pass sales is to provide more
                      variety of them. For example by linking them to shorter
                      events rather than long seasons (meaning accelerating the
                      release ratio), or by having additional passes linked to
                      specific game modes, meaning that there are more passes
                      running in parallel (although increases the risk of
                      cannibalizing player attention). This approach can
                      significatively increase the revenue from Passes.

                      Monster Legends features two different pass systems: One
                      for the core game (Legends Pass) and another for the
                      Multiplayer game mode (Battle Pass). This increases the
                      number of Passes bought by engaged players.

                      Archero has two Premium tiers running on top of the Pass,
                      each granting bigger benefits. This allows low spenders to
                      find an affordable price point, while also incentivizing
                      high spenders to buy them both. (Thanks Harshal Karvande
                      from the DoF community for the pics!)

                      As an alternative to the Battle Pass, Fortnite offers a
                      subscription system. On top of the Pass, subscribers
                      obtain an exclusive skin and additional currency.
                      According to Game Refinery, Call of Duty Mobile is testing
                      a similar feature.

                      Fortnite allows players to purchase and give Passes to
                      others, which has the unfortunate effect of making my

                      bundle of Gold Passes with a 20% discount. The obvious
                      intention is to try to move this high-value purchase to

                      platform fees. These Passes can be activated by the
                      player, or gifted to others.

                      One of the explicit selling points of the Call of Duty
                      Mobile is that players can earn enough hard currency to
                      get the next Pass for free. This requires that the player
                      reaches the end levels of the Pass, which may prove
                      difficult.

                      Finally, in terms of value and appeal, one of the points
                      to consider is{" "}

                    <span>
                      . Not granting hard currency in the Pass can make it seem
                      worthless. But if not kept in check, this can potentially
                      generate a loop where engaged players pay once and never
                      more.

                      The long answer is a bit more complex: The optimal length
                      of a Pass is the result of a balance between how often can
                      players be convinced to pay for it, how much Pass content
                      will overflow the game, and how much time does it take to
                      create meaningful rewards, and how long a Pass can last

                      the Pass. (i.e. if progression in the Pass is achieved by

                      engagement/mid engagement/low engagement player achieves

                      This is the most common and balanced option but also makes
                      it a bit more challenging to make the premium track big
                      milestones feel more valuable than the regular one.
                      Therefore, it forces to remark the difference through the

                      Call of Duty Mobile and Beatstar have more tiers in the
                      premium track. This greatly reinforces the value of
                      monetizing, as it’s the only way to avoid the frustrating
                      feeling of reaching milestones for nothing. In these

                      rewards to differentiate the tracks.

                      that the Pass has a strong focus on being an engagement

                      Brawl Stars features time-limited quests that incentivize
                      players to come back every day, but also releases
                      permanent quests weekly for additional engagement. On top
                      of that, most quests are related to a specific character
                      or game mode, pushing for horizontal exploration and
                      inventory expansion.

                      Royal Match Pass progression is achieved by completing
                      players. It works great for them since (1) there are not a
                      lot of other things to do anyway, (2) it keeps information
                      simple for casual players, and (3) it reinforces the main
                      monetization tools of the game (buy lives, buy extra
                      moves, and buy boosters to complete more levels).

                      Everything above is but a catalog of different options.
                      Designing a Pass is an exercise of taking decisions: XP
                      should be generated missions or core loop? Should it be
                      monthly or quarterly? Be pricey or very cheap?

                      And while some options have obvious advantages (like
                      having missions over the core loop, or having a big amount
                      of low-value rewards), there’s no decision that is better

                      In Clash Mini, the Pass is the main progression mechanic
                      of the game. Its cyclical nature makes it easier to
                      introduce new content and avoids the grindy stagnation
                      that happens in other Supercell games by providing a new
                      Pass every so often. In Brawl Stars, the Pass has also
                      become the de facto progression system, displacing the
                      Trophy Road.

                      Hay Day Pop is an example of a failed attempt of replacing
                      the classic permanent progression model. IMHO this didn’t
                      work because it forced players to repeat past levels
                      instead of having a linear progression where each level
                      was unique, and I believe it’s one of the key reasons why
                      the game ultimately failed.

                      I am skeptical that games will find ways to introduce
                      additional purchases inside the pass (tier skips, mission
                      rolls…), and I believe that tier skips will decrease in
                      relevance, and mission re-rolls will become free,

                      McMaster-Carr is an industrial supply company. They sell
                      nuts, bolts, bushings, bearings – pretty much anything an
                      engineer needs to build stuff. I've purchased from them
                      dozens of times over the past few years, both for personal
                      and school projects.

                      But what makes their website so great? And why should an
                      industrial supply company have the best e-commerce site on
                      the internet?

                      First, let's look at the visual design of the site.
                      Minimal, mostly grayscale, with accents of green and
                      yellow. There are no popups, animations, banners,
                      carousels, or videos – just a calm, static page with
                      categories and a search bar. Even the images are
                      grayscale, to avoid inadvertently catching your eye.

                      A user's goal when they visit McMaster-Carr is to find
                      their part as quickly as possible. The website is designed
                      entirely around that fact. Users rarely come just to
                      browse, so there are no AI recommendation algorithms,
                      featured products, new arrivals – that doesn't make sense
                      in this context. People visit McMaster-Carr with high
                      intent to buy a specific part, that's it.

                      McMaster shows me several subcategories: hex head, socket

                      McMaster's search interface is the main reason for its

                      get you to your part as quickly as possible. The filter
                      sections are simple and elegant, providing schematic
                      illustrations when necessary. The illustrations are always
                      simplified to convey only relevant information, as to not
                      distract you from the focus of your search.

                      Results pages also show helpful drop-downs which explain
                      the parts you're looking at. It's like an engineer's
                      handbook and catalog in one. Engineers are often looking
                      up terminology on the fly anyways, so having this
                      information embedded into the site saves valuable time.

                      McMaster's filters are not only useful for a targeted
                      search, but also for deciding what it is you want.
                      Sometimes I'll search with only a general idea of the part
                      I need, and then I'll use the subcategory descriptions to
                      determine specifics. For example, I may know that I need
                      some type of lock washer, but I'm unsure which one is best
                      for my application. I can use the images and descriptions
                      to decide on the right configuration.

                      McMaster is able to provide such intuitive searching and
                      filtering because everything that they sell is highly
                      legible – it's all defined by quantitative specs. There is

                      photos, or other marketing fluff. Even still, they do a

                      As a point of comparison, Amazon does a terrible job of
                      filtering items. Amazon has an order of magnitude more
                      products on its site, which admittedly makes the job a lot
                      more difficult. However, even generic filters, like price,
                      suck. I won't get too far into my disdain for amazon's UI
                      design, other people have already written too much about
                      it [1] and that's not the point, but it's interesting to
                      contrast McMaster with what everyone sees as "the"
                      e-commerce site.

                      Take Amazon's price picker: Why is it two text boxes? Why
                      not a slider? This has always annoyed me, since it's much
                      easier for me to drag a slider than to manually type in my
                      max price. And the quick-select ranges are literally the
                      exact same no matter the product. If I search for a pen,
                      nearly every result I want should be under $25. If I
                      search for a trampoline, every result I want should
                      probably be over $200. What the fuck?! I guess this
                      somehow won the A/B test, but I can't think of a reason
                      why.

                      Finally, one of the most brilliant parts of McMaster's
                      product is that for nearly every part, they have a CAD
                      file that you can instantly download into your 3D models.
                      Mechanical engineers mock up designs in CAD programs
                      before actually building them, and having access to
                      pre-modeled parts saves time. (Imagine having to manually
                      model all your nuts and bolts.) McMaster even has{" "}

                      engineer's lives 10x easier (not to mention making them
                      more likely to purchase from McMaster-Carr). The closest
                      analogy to this is AR try-on, but that's not even very

                      you like the item you're about to buy, whereas the point
                      of McMaster's CAD downloads is to speed up an engineer's
                      workflow. In most cases, they already know which part they
                      need, it's just a matter of completing the CAD model
                      before they can start building the real thing.

                      overwhelming to comb through dozens of product photos, so
                      I pretty much always use the search bar to start narrowing
                      down items. The main area of the homepage is effectively
                      dead space, while the search bar is relatively tiny. New
                      users might miss it, wasting time.

                      rare to see such careful thought go into an industrial web

                      micro-manages every single pixel of Amazon's retail site.
                      He hired Larry Tesler, Apple's Chief Scientist and
                      probably the very most famous and respected human-computer
                      interaction expert in the entire world, and then ignored
                      every goddamn thing Larry said for three years until Larry
                      finally -- wisely -- left the company. Larry would do
                      these big usability studies and demonstrate beyond any
                      shred of doubt that nobody can understand that frigging
                      website, but Bezos just couldn't let go of those pixels,
                      all those millions of semantics-packed pixels on the
                      landing page. They were like millions of his own precious
                      children. So they're all still there, and Larry is not."{" "}

                      When YouTube was founded in 2005, people often arrived at
                      its videos from a link sent by a friend or found in a
                      Google search. A fair number also came in through its
                      homepage, which company engineers populated by slotting in
                      popular or amusing videos between coding sessions. But
                      wider exposure and new business deals demanded a better
                      approach. By the summer of 2006, YouTube had already
                      become a mass-media must-see, with more than 100 million
                      daily views. Verizon Wireless, which agreed to put a

                      interested in something similar, according to multiple
                      people at YouTube involved in discussions.

                      So YouTube hired an editor. Mia Quagliarello, who had been
                      a manager at iTunes, joined the company to program
                      YouTube’s homepage and packages for partners such as
                      Verizon. Flush with Google cash—the internet giant had
                      just acquired the start-up for $1.65 billion—Quagliarello
                      recruited a small team of staffers to keep close tabs on
                      YouTube’s sprawling culture. She started with Joseph
                      Smith, a graveyard-shift screener at YouTube whom everyone
                      called “Big Joe,” who was remarkably adept at spotting
                      budding viral hits before they exploded in popularity.
                      Harper, a high-school friend of one of YouTube’s founders,
                      Steve Chen, joined shortly after. In the months that
                      followed, Quagliarello brought in a journalist, a radio
                      DJ, and actual YouTubers as editors to sift through
                      content on sports, comedy, politics, and other fields,
                      finding gems that viewers might love. Officially, these
                      team members were called “community managers.” But a
                      colleague devised a more resonant title for the team: the
                      coolhunters.

                      YouTube wasn’t yet a commercial hit. The company started

                      YouTube preferred to feature original songs, not covers.
                      Still, even when the coolhunters passed on a technicality,
                      YouTube minted stars—a year later, a record executive
                      would find Bieber’s videos on YouTube and make him a pop

                      Every morning, Harper scoured a list she’d assembled of
                      blogs and internet arcana, searching for interesting
                      videos. When she found ones worth putting on the homepage,
                      she would add them to YouTube’s “Featured Videos” banner,
                      which stacked small frames of videos in a column of 10.
                      Her team swapped these slots every four hours, giving

                      YouTube’s coolhunters were tastemakers, and they were
                      among the first at the company to actually reach out to
                      the delightful weirdos populating its site. Michele
                      Flannery, a former local-radio director who curated
                      YouTube’s music videos, told me she liked to prowl for
                      unconventional artists, such as quirky ukulele players and
                      indie rockers. “Make it really personal and intimate,” she
                      advised musicians posting on YouTube who wanted to be
                      featured on the homepage, “like you’re sitting in your
                      bedroom.” The coolhunters latched onto this aesthetic and
                      experimented themselves. They invited the filmmaker Rob
                      Zombie, and later Wes Craven, to guest edit for Halloween.

                      As a lark, the community managers planned their first
                      “takeover,” filling the entire YouTube homepage with
                      tributes to the song. An engineer rushed over in panic,
                      assuming that YouTube had been hacked. The coolhunters
                      would repeat the gimmick and{" "}

                      During YouTube’s first couple of years at Google, the
                      parent company largely left it alone. Google lawyers
                      helped YouTube fight legal battles, and Google’s balance
                      sheet funded YouTube’s blitzkrieg expansion into new
                      countries around the world. But YouTube was mostly
                      independent.

                      Eventually, though, Google’s sensibilities started to
                      trickle in. “The Google way of solving problems is to
                      throw machines at them, not people,” recalls Andy Stack, a
                      former YouTube manager. Sadia Harper encountered this
                      first with cars. A few years into coolhunting, she began
                      curating automotive videos as the coolhunters added new
                      categories to cover the site’s expanse. She liked cars.
                      People liked watching them on YouTube—car races, Humvees
                      climbing walls, detailed tutorials on engines.
                      Periodically, Harper would slot interesting footage onto
                      YouTube’s homepage. One day, she told me, a programmer
                      approached her desk and explained that engineers had
                      developed an algorithm for picking homepage videos
                      designed to get optimal clicks. They wanted to test it on
                      a trial category. They picked cars.

                      The coder loaded a sample page of videos that the
                      algorithm had selected.{" "}

                    <span>
                      . The reloaded page filled with “revving” videos—footage
                      shot inside luxury vehicles where cameras lingered on the
                      foot or lower half of the driver, usually a woman in
                      heels, pumping the accelerator. Often, leather was
                      involved. Harper had seen those sorts of videos and
                      intentionally ignored them. “That’s a fetish,” she
                      protested. “That’s not what we’re about.”

                      YouTube wasn’t new to algorithmic sorting, but its first
                      iterations were fairly primitive. When someone clicked on
                      a video, the page’s right flank—its “related videos”
                      section—filled with clips that other viewers who clicked
                      on that same video had watched. The algorithm was
                      accounting for “co-visitation”:{" "}
                    </span>
                    <span>
                      <em>People who like this also like that</em>

                    <span>
                      . Erik Klein, an early YouTube engineer, recalls the
                      limits of this approach with huge viral hits that everyone
                      co-visited; viewers, staff joked, were always two videos
                      away from seeing Justin Bieber. Algorithm experiments
                      could go awry, sometimes showing too much of the
                      internet’s dark mirror. Before Google’s acquisition,
                      YouTube programmers once tweaked their system and saw
                      video clicks shoot up, only to discover that “every three
                      or four videos, you would end up with a cat video or
                      someone in a bikini,” remembers Jasson Schrock, a former
                      YouTube designer.

                      Programmers went back to the drawing board, adding more
                      filters for decency into the code. Google brought more
                      computing horsepower and coding proficiency, letting
                      YouTube measure granular signals such as how long people
                      lingered on videos, what time of day they watched, and
                      from where. YouTube’s algorithms improved. At first, they
                      couldn’t detect a butt from a peach and left that to human
                      moderators, but eventually, YouTube developed
                      skin-detection software to remove obscene stuff
                      automatically. Related videos started clocking more
                      clicks. The formula looked ready for prime time on the
                      homepage.

                      By 2009, YouTube’s business was preparing for prime time
                      too. Google began tightening its belt after the financial
                      crisis, and YouTube, although a cultural phenomenon, was a
                      perpetual money pit. New managers arrived to whip YouTube
                      into profitable shape. The coolhunters looked less and
                      less relevant to YouTube’s commercial future and to
                      Google’s culture. When Lady Gaga’s hit “Telephone” debuted
                      in March of 2010, Google salespeople wanted the music
                      video, a raunchy, slick featurette set in a women’s
                      prison, to premiere as a paid promotion on YouTube.
                      Flannery remembers the coolhunters protesting that
                      similarly raunchy videos from amateur YouTubers would be
                      “age-gated” and prohibited from the homepage. The
                      salespeople and Lady Gaga won. On another occasion, Harper
                      recalled, a YouTube sales leader asked her to feature an
                      advertiser’s video. When Harper declined, citing the
                      material’s so-so quality, the salesman pointed to the
                      assorted clips that coolhunters had curated and asked her,
                      “Is that stuff any better?”

                      According to more than 10 interviews with YouTube staffers
                      familiar with the dynamics, some of the company’s
                      higher-ups had growing misgivings about the coolhunter
                      team. Viacom had sued YouTube over copyright infringement,
                      arguing that YouTube knowingly let pirated copy run
                      rampant. To some, an operation that sifted through videos
                      to feature didn’t help the legal defense that YouTube was
                      a hands-off platform (Google and Viacom eventually settled
                      out of court). And as YouTube launched in more and more
                      countries, replicating a curatorial team for each country
                      felt too costly and time-consuming. “We couldn’t run that
                      fast enough,” recalls Chen, YouTube’s co-founder and early
                      technical chief. Besides, software was cheaper. Some signs
                      indicated that the curated homepage wasn’t driving growth;
                      people went there to search, not to linger or click on
                      clips. A few people at Google thought the coolhunters
                      operated as hidden kingmakers, picking, almost like
                      Hollywood producers or agents, which YouTubers would
                      become stars. And Facebook, then surging in popularity,
                      was attracting users and advertisers based on a social
                      feed of content tailored just so for every individual.

                      But the most damning case against the coolhunters was that
                      they lacked a way to measure themselves. At Google,
                      everything was measured. Harper, who had studied
                      mathematics, put together a data analysis trying to
                      quantify the impact of her team’s virtual town square. It
                      was not enough. Around early 2010, a new YouTube product
                      manager began meeting with the editorial team to discuss
                      ways that the homepage could be more “relevant” to
                      viewers, primarily with more personalized algorithms like
                      Facebook had. Mark Day, YouTube’s comedy editor, had an
                      epiphany during one of these gatherings.{" "}

                      Shortly after, in 2010, the coolhunters were disbanded.
                      Most members were reassigned to work in marketing roles
                      helping brand-name companies sell on the site. YouTube’s

                      YouTube would likely never have become a staple of pop
                      culture without the small, early team that cemented its
                      coolness and nurtured its first viral hits. But at the
                      same time, YouTube may not have become the behemoth it is
                      today if it had kept relying on human curators. In the
                      years since, YouTube has sometimes toyed with handpicking
                      videos, featuring select creators or trends that the
                      company wants to highlight. And YouTube has resorted to
                      curation to manage messes from its scale—putting content
                      from health agencies and news outlets in prominent places
                      during the pandemic and other events prone to conspiracy
                      mongering. Often, these efforts feel drowned out by the
                      platform’s sheer enormity. It’s like “putting a thimble in
                      a gushing geyser,” says Claire Stapleton, a manager hired
                      in 2014 to curate marketing content.

                      Survivor.io is an action-adventure game offered by Habby.
                      Developer behind the ultimate mobile game hit Archero.
                      Survivor.io requires you to take the mantle of a hero out
                      to save the city from a zombie apocalypse.

                      The entire humankind stares at extinction as an unknown
                      virus turns people into zombies. The infection spreads
                      like wildfire, and the once vibrant metropolis becomes a
                      city of the undead.

                      game is for nothing, if it does not have any users. We
                      live in a world where „go big or die“ is the main mantra
                      for business growth. If you want to make money from your
                      app, or game, you need to convert users to customers,
                      consumers, buyers… But you cannot do that without having
                      them first as a users.

                      There are many skills that you can unlock as you advance
                      in the game. They will come in handy, especially when
                      dealing with difficult challenges. Some of the
                      skills/weapons that you can unlock include my favourite
                      Gatling. This is an incredible massacre machine that can
                      take down large hordes of zombies with ease.{" "}

                      . The most crucial part of mobile games development is to
                      lay strong foundations from the very beginning. Early
                      marketability testing allows you to gain insights into how
                      well your mobile game’s creative concept will perform
                      during user acquisition, but also how your game concept
                      resonates with the target audience. I’ve run hundreds of
                      campaigns on different games using different types of
                      creatives.

                      scale your budget until the LTV allows you to do so. Eg.
                      If your LTV is $5, you can run profitable campaigns until
                      you hit $4.5 CPI (or any other CPI that you calculate
                      based on your margins) This is very simplified, because
                      you need to take into consideration a payback period of
                      your campaigns = when do you want to see your money back.

                      Asia. Habby started ramping up spend on Tuesday 9th of

                      On the third place we have Google and then Unity which
                      shows mostly Chinese creatives. Facebook, Vungle and
                      Applovin are kinda small in comparison to the first 3.
                      This is a great testament of how the UA landscape changed
                      over the last couple of months/year. It’s not about
                      Facebook or Google anymore. In order to scale your game
                      you need to run profitable campaigns on multiple UA
                      sources and diversify as much as possible. Or as much as
                      LTV allows you to do so as explained earlier.

                      With Survivor.io we can see simple gameplay variations.
                      But! They are perfectly crafted by the developer. It’s not
                      only gameplay capture. They alter the gameplay to showcase
                      huge amounts of zombies, use meme headlines, hyper casual
                      creative, fail scenarios (lose-upgrade-win) and skills
                      upgrade concepts and that’s it. As simple as it sounds.

                      The reason we had to start off with step 1 was that it was
                      all I could afford to do with what I made from PayPal. I
                      thought our chances of success were so low that I didn't
                      want to risk anyone's funds in the beginning but my own.
                      The list of successful car company startups is short. As
                      of 2016, the number of American car companies that haven't
                      gone bankrupt is a grand total of two: Ford and Tesla.
                      Starting a car company is idiotic and an electric car
                      company is idiocy squared.

                      Also, a low volume car means a much smaller, simpler
                      factory, albeit with most things done by hand. Without
                      economies of scale, anything we built would be expensive,
                      whether it was an economy sedan or a sports car. While at
                      least some people would be prepared to pay a high price
                      for a sports car, no one was going to pay $100k for an
                      electric Honda Civic, no matter how cool it looked.

                      Part of the reason I wrote the first master plan was to
                      defend against the inevitable attacks Tesla would face
                      accusing us of just caring about making cars for rich
                      people, implying that we felt there was a shortage of
                      sports car companies or some other bizarre rationale.
                      Unfortunately, the blog didn't stop countless attack
                      articles on exactly these grounds, so it pretty much
                      completely failed that objective.

                      However, the main reason was to explain how our actions
                      fit into a larger picture, so that they would seem less
                      random. The point of all this was, and remains,
                      accelerating the advent of sustainable energy, so that we
                      can imagine far into the future and life is still good.
                      That's what "sustainable" means. It's not some silly,
                      hippy thing -- it matters for everyone.

                      By definition, we must at some point achieve a sustainable
                      energy economy or we will run out of fossil fuels to burn
                      and civilization will collapse. Given that we must get off
                      fossil fuels anyway and that virtually all scientists

                      We can't do this well if Tesla and SolarCity are different
                      companies, which is why we need to combine and break down
                      the barriers inherent to being separate companies. That
                      they are separate at all, despite similar origins and
                      pursuit of the same overarching goal of sustainable
                      energy, is largely an accident of history. Now that Tesla
                      is ready to scale Powerwall and SolarCity is ready to
                      provide highly differentiated solar, the time has come to
                      bring them together.

                      Today, Tesla addresses two relatively small segments of
                      premium sedans and SUVs. With the Model 3, a future
                      compact SUV and a new kind of pickup truck, we plan to
                      address most of the consumer market. A lower cost vehicle
                      than the Model 3 is unlikely to be necessary, because of
                      the third part of the plan described below.

                      What really matters to accelerate a sustainable future is
                      being able to scale up production volume as quickly as
                      possible. That is why Tesla engineering has transitioned
                      to focus heavily on designing the machine that makes the
                      machine -- turning the factory{" "}

                      to 10 fold improvement is achievable by version 3 on a
                      roughly 2 year iteration cycle. The first Model 3 factory
                      machine should be thought of as version 0.5, with version
                      1.0 probably in 2018.

                      In addition to consumer vehicles, there are two other
                      types of electric vehicle needed: heavy-duty trucks and
                      high passenger-density urban transport. Both are in the
                      early stages of development at Tesla and should be ready
                      for unveiling next year. We believe the Tesla Semi will
                      deliver a substantial reduction in the cost of cargo
                      transport, while increasing safety and making it really

                      With the advent of autonomy, it will probably make sense
                      to shrink the size of buses and transition the role of bus
                      driver to that of fleet manager. Traffic congestion would
                      improve due to increased passenger areal density by
                      eliminating the center aisle and putting seats where there
                      are currently entryways, and matching acceleration and
                      braking to other vehicles, thus avoiding the inertial
                      impedance to smooth traffic flow of traditional heavy
                      buses. It would also take people all the way to their
                      destination. Fixed summon buttons at existing bus stops
                      would serve those who don't have a phone. Design
                      accommodates wheelchairs, strollers and bikes.

                      As the technology matures, all Tesla vehicles will have
                      the hardware necessary to be fully self-driving with
                      fail-operational capability, meaning that any given system
                      in the car could break and your car will still drive
                      itself safely. It is important to emphasize that
                      refinement and validation of the software will take much
                      longer than putting in place the cameras, radar, sonar and
                      computing hardware.

                      Even once the software is highly refined and far better

                      significant time gap, varying widely by jurisdiction,
                      before true self-driving is approved by regulators. We
                      expect that worldwide regulatory approval will require
                      something on the order of 6 billion miles (10 billion km).
                      Current fleet learning is happening at just over 3 million

                      I should add a note here to explain why Tesla is deploying
                      partial autonomy now, rather than waiting until some point
                      in the future. The most important reason is that, when
                      used correctly, it is already significantly safer than a
                      person driving by themselves and it would therefore be
                      morally reprehensible to delay release simply for fear of
                      bad press or some mercantile calculation of legal
                      liability.

                      According to the recently released 2015 NHTSA report,
                      automotive fatalities increased by 8% to one death every
                      89 million miles. Autopilot miles will soon exceed twice
                      that number and the system gets better every day. It would
                      no more make sense to disable Tesla's Autopilot, as some

                      aircraft, after which our system is named.

                      It is also important to explain why we refer to Autopilot
                      as "beta". This is not beta software in any normal sense
                      of the word. Every release goes through extensive internal
                      validation before it reaches any customers. It is called
                      beta in order to decrease complacency and indicate that it
                      will continue to improve (Autopilot is always off by
                      default). Once we get to the point where Autopilot is
                      approximately 10 times safer than the US vehicle average,
                      the beta label will be removed.

                      When true self-driving is approved by regulators, it will
                      mean that you will be able to summon your Tesla from
                      pretty much anywhere. Once it picks you up, you will be
                      able to sleep, read or do anything else enroute to your
                      destination.

                      You will also be able to add your car to the Tesla shared
                      fleet just by tapping a button on the Tesla phone app and
                      have it generate income for you while you're at work or on
                      vacation, significantly offsetting and at times
                      potentially exceeding the monthly loan or lease cost. This
                      dramatically lowers the true cost of ownership to the
                      point where almost anyone could own a Tesla. Since most
                      cars are only in use by their owner for 5% to 10% of the
                      day, the fundamental economic utility of a true
                      self-driving car is likely to be several times that of a
                      car which is not.

                      If you look at a broad cross-section of startups—say, 30
                      or 40 or more; enough to screen out the pure flukes and
                      look for patterns—two obvious facts will jump out at you.

                      First obvious fact: there is an incredibly wide divergence
                      of success—some of those startups are insanely successful,
                      some highly successful, many somewhat successful, and
                      quite a few of course outright fail.

                      You can obviously screw up a great market—and that has
                      been done, and not infrequently—but assuming the team is
                      baseline competent and the product is fundamentally
                      acceptable, a great market will tend to equal success and
                      a poor market will tend to equal failure.{" "}

                      In my experience, the most frequent case of great team
                      paired with bad product and/or terrible market is the
                      second- or third-time entrepreneur whose first company was
                      a huge success. People get cocky, and slip up. There is
                      one high-profile, highly successful software entrepreneur
                      right now who is burning through something like $80
                      million in venture funding in his latest startup and has
                      practically nothing to show for it except for some great
                      press clippings and a couple of beta customers—because
                      there is virtually no market for what he is building.

                      Conversely, I can name you any number of weak teams whose

                      Ironically, once a startup is successful, and you ask the

                        questions than it answers. How exactly do you go about
                        getting to product/market fit if you don’t hit it right
                        out of the gate? How do you evaluate markets for size
                        and quality, especially before they’re fully formed?
                        What actually makes a product “fit” a market? What role
                        does timing play? How do you know when to change
                        strategy and go after a different market or build a
                        different product? When do you need to change out some
                        or all of your team? And why can’t you count on on a
                        great team to build the right product and find the right
                        market? All these topics will be discussed in future

                      On August 28, 1907, nineteen-year-old James Emmett “Jim”
                      Casey and his friend Claude Ryan borrowed $100 and founded
                      the American Messenger Company in a six-foot by seven-foot
                      basement office below a Seattle saloon. They hired six
                      boys to deliver telegraph and other messages throughout
                      Seattle and run errands for people. Nine competing
                      messenger services already existed in booming Seattle,
                      America’s closest port to Asia and gateway to the riches
                      of Alaska and the Yukon.

                      From those humble beginnings sprang United Parcel Service,
                      known today as just “UPS,” the world’s largest and most
                      valuable transportation company. In 2017, the company
                      delivered over 5 billion packages to 220 countries. UPS is
                      one of the world’s largest (and best) non-government
                      employers, with 454,000 employees.

                      Henry Casey came from County Galway, Ireland. Annie
                      Sheehan was the daughter of immigrants from Ireland’s
                      County Cork. The two met in Chicago, where they were
                      married. The young couple soon moved to the mining
                      district of Candelaria, Nevada, where they ran a saloon.
                      Henry prospected for silver, but contracted a miner’s lung
                      disease. On March 29, 1888, the first of their four
                      children, James Emmett Casey, was born.

                      Seattle, a booming city of 65,000 people. This growth
                      accelerated in the summer of 1897 when 100,000 prospectors
                      rushed for newly discovered gold in the Klondike region of
                      Canada’s Yukon Territory. It has been estimated that only
                      one in four succeeded in the rough journey to the Yukon.
                      Henry Casey was one of those who failed: his ship wrecked
                      and hobbled into the nearest port. Getting sicker and
                      sicker, Henry returned to Seattle.

                      In this context, Jim had already quit school at the age of
                      eleven. He found work assisting a delivery driver for
                      Seattle’s leading store, the Bon Marche department store,
                      at $2.50 a week. He soon learned the streets, alleyways,
                      and house numbering system of the city. Three weeks into
                      that job, he found higher pay delivering for a tea store
                      and continued his education in “street smarts.” Jim’s two
                      younger brothers also went to work, together supporting
                      the family (which added a baby girl in 1900) on $6 a week.

                      By mid-1901, Jim was making $5 a week working for the tea
                      store. Desiring to go back to school, he quit that job for
                      a lower-paying night job at American District Telegraph
                      (ADT). Working the 7 p.m.–7 a.m. shift, Jim delivered
                      messages and ran errands. He befriended another young ADT
                      “footpad” (messenger boy), Claude Ryan. On the job, their
                      adventures were diverse: notifying railroad engineers of
                      emergency runs; babysitting kids while their parents went
                      to the theater; pumping a church organ for choir practice;
                      collecting bail for jailbirds; and delivering liquor,
                      cocaine, and opium to customers. Jim even followed spouses
                      for suspicious husbands and wives.

                      After two more terms of school, the family’s need for
                      money and ADT’s need for Jim’s time and energy forced him
                      to drop out, ending his formal education. Nevertheless, as
                      his life story makes clear, Jim Casey never stopped
                      learning, reading, and listening to others. His intense

                      the City Messenger Service to deliver “telephone
                      messages.” Few Seattle residents had phones, but City
                      Messenger Service had two phones, one each from the two
                      early phone companies serving businesses and the wealthy.
                      Business was slow, and after two years the young men sold
                      the company.

                      Jim and one of his partners then decided to try mining, as
                      Henry had done. They headed to Goldfield, Nevada, the site
                      of another big strike. Failing at mining, the two hired a
                      third man, John Moritz, and began another messenger
                      service. The three made $50 a month delivering messages
                      from the local telephone and telegraph office. In perhaps
                      his first experience with uniforms, the boys wore pillbox
                      hats and double-breasted jackets with brass buttons. This
                      business was a success, but then partner John Moritz was
                      shot and killed by a vagrant. Disheartened, the other two
                      returned to Seattle.

                      Following these adventures, nineteen-year-old Jim reunited
                      with his ADT friend Claude Ryan to start yet another
                      messenger service, this time called the American Messenger
                      Company, on August 28, 1907. Borrowing $100 in startup
                      funds, they acquired two telephones, two bicycles for
                      long-distance deliveries, and hired six boys. They offered
                      “the best service and the lowest rates” compared to their
                      nine competitors. Moreover, they told customers the truth
                      about when they would pick up their message or package, an
                      unusual practice in the competitive business. Jim’s motto
                      became, “Never promise more than you can deliver, and
                      always deliver what you promise.”

                      Jim and Claude knew the flow of goods and information in
                      Seattle; they knew every nook and cranny of the city. They
                      posted placards all around Seattle with their phone number
                      and their service and price offering. They charged 15 to
                      65 cents per message, depending on distance, or 25 cents
                      per hour for errands. American Messenger offered 24-hour
                      service, seven days a week, with the two founders often
                      sleeping on the old lunch counter they used as a desk in
                      their tiny basement office.

                      As in his prior experience, Jim and his friends had to run
                      many odd errands. One posed for an art class; another took
                      a blind man to a funeral. They minded stores when the
                      owner went to lunch and walked dogs for other customers.
                      This made the business complex and hard to plan. In
                      addition, many customers would call several messenger
                      companies and then give the business to the first to
                      arrive, further wasting the time of his messengers.

                      Jim hungered for a way to streamline the business, and
                      found it when the nearby King Brothers Clothing store
                      hired American Messenger to deliver merchandise to
                      customers. This consistent daily business added to the
                      revenue American Messenger received from each trip.

                      American Messenger moved to bigger offices and opened a

                      Casey joined the business in 1911. By 1912, they had ten
                      messengers at work, which swelled to seventy-five in the
                      Christmas season.

                      especially the giant department stores which dominated
                      retailing in that era. His idea was that the stores would
                      save money by eliminating their large fleets of
                      horse-drawn delivery vehicles. And their customers would
                      receive merchandise from multiple stores in one delivery
                      rather than waiting at home all day for multiple
                      deliveries.

                      “Partnering up” with other messenger services rather than
                      using scarce cash to buy them out became a modus operandi
                      for the realization of Jim’s bigger dreams. In 1913,
                      American Messenger merged with Evert “Mac” McCabe’s
                      Motorcycle Delivery Company. Mac was an extroverted
                      salesman and had as much energy as Jim and Claude. Mac’s
                      wife, Garnet McCabe, helped with the office, but she had a
                      reputation of being hard to get along with. The combined
                      company, now called Merchants Parcel Delivery, had
                      twenty-five messengers and six motorcycles, and soon added
                      a Ford Model T with a bright red van body on the chassis.
                      By 1915, the company was the largest delivery service in
                      Seattle, with four cars, five motorcycles, and thirty
                      messengers on foot. Merchants Parcel covered 1,600 miles a
                      day and generated $2,200 a month in revenue.

                      The company needed more cash if it were to continue
                      growing, however. After being turned down by bankers, in
                      1916 Jim convinced Charlie Soderstrom to buy $10,000 worth
                      of Merchants Parcel stock. Charlie was a veteran delivery
                      driver who headed the delivery operations of one of
                      Seattle’s four department stores, Fraser-Paterson. He
                      understood the delivery business and was impressed by Jim
                      and Claude’s skills, integrity, and drive. Charlie
                      Soderstrom brought to the company a knowledge of vehicles
                      and instilled in Jim the importance of washing and
                      maintaining them, a practice that continues at UPS today.

                      Merchants Parcel considered painting their cars and vans
                      bright yellow to attract attention, or even painting them
                      different colors to make people think the company was
                      larger than it was. But Charlie warned that they should
                      not try to show up their retail customers, who were proud
                      of their brightly decorated delivery vehicles. He had
                      studied the more subtle Pullman brown, the color used on
                      railroad sleeping cars to minimize signs of dust and dirt.
                      Thus the partners decided to go with brown—only slightly
                      modified in today’s UPS brown.

                      In 1917, reportedly due to conflicts with Garnet McCabe,
                      Claude Ryan left the company. Jim’s brother George Casey
                      joined the navy in World War I, but returned to the
                      company two years later. From then on, the driving forces
                      of Merchants Parcel were Jim and George Casey, Charlie
                      Soderstrom, and Mac McCabe.

                      Under Jim’s leadership, the group never stopped improving,
                      never stopped learning, and wanted to grow. Jim developed
                      a bin-based parcel sorting system. He reached out to one
                      hundred other delivery companies across America for new
                      ideas, but found little that he and his partners were not
                      already doing.

                      During this period, Merchants Parcel got its first big
                      customer, Seattle’s Bon Marche department store, named
                      after the famous Paris store. Jim and his colleagues made
                      three pickups every day at the big store. The leading
                      stores were reluctant to give up their own delivery
                      operations, where they could advertise on the vehicles and
                      insure good service. At first, “The Bon” kept its own
                      fleet and used Merchants, but was soon satisfied with the
                      new service and abandoned its own delivery fleet.
                      Gradually, Merchants Parcel won over three of the four
                      biggest stores in Seattle. In the coming years, delivering
                      for big retail clients became the key business of the
                      company. “B2C” (business-to-consumer) deliveries became
                      their specialty. In many cases, Jim and his partners took
                      over the stores’ fleets and hired their delivery
                      employees.

                      In this same era, in pursuit of efficiency, Merchants
                      started using the same driver every day on the same
                      assigned route, so that customers could get to know their
                      driver. And the company began a policy of making three
                      delivery attempts before returning the goods to the
                      shipper. Both of these policies remain intact at UPS
                      today.

                      As World War I came to an end, the partners wanted to
                      expand to other cities and needed cash. A prominent banker
                      turned them down but inspired them by saying, “Determined
                      men can do anything.” Jim adopted this slogan and expanded
                      upon it to say, “Determined men, working together, can do
                      anything.” From the outset, he had learned to respect his
                      co-workers and to solicit their ideas—from his co-owners
                      to the lowliest delivery boys.

                      The partners discovered that Motor Parcel Delivery of
                      Oakland, California, was in financial trouble and acquired
                      the company with little cash outlay.

                      In nearby San Francisco, there was already a Merchants
                      Parcel company, so they could not use that name in the Bay
                      Area. George liked the word “United” as in United Fruit.
                      Mac suggested United Parcel, as Jim was insistent that
                      Parcel be part of the name. And Charlie said their core
                      was Service. Thus the name “United Parcel Service” was
                      born (years later shortened to just “UPS”). With Jim as
                      president, United Parcel Service opened in Oakland in
                      February 1919. (The company continued to use the name
                      Merchants Parcel in Seattle until 1925.)

                      In the following years, United Parcel Service continued to
                      buy other delivery companies, usually by using shares of
                      stock, thus conserving cash. One small Los Angeles
                      delivery company they acquired in this manner was owned by
                      Joe Meiklejohn; his heirs later gave Orange County
                      hospitals over $80 million from the wealth UPS created for
                      them.

                      In the early 1920s, Jim and his partners moved their
                      headquarters to Los Angeles, which became an important
                      center for them. While continuing to focus on local
                      delivery for retailers, one of the companies they acquired
                      there had “common carrier” rights—the legal ability to
                      carry any package of any size to any address over a
                      broader area of Southern California. This move diversified
                      the company’s revenue base into “B2B”
                      (business-to-business) but also took them into the more
                      heavily regulated trucking industry.

                      Los Angeles area; by the Christmas peak of 1929, the

                      operations, which UPS did. Portland was added in 1927.

                      key role in choosing brown, naming the company, and taking
                      care of the vehicles (always called “package cars,” never

                      The 1920s saw UPS’s introduction of automatic car washes
                      for its vehicles, conveyor belts for sorting, and the
                      now-famous brown uniforms. From the start, Jim was
                      obsessed with the appearance of his drivers. The company
                      had (and has) strict rules on appearance. Jim himself was
                      always impeccably dressed in a pressed, conservative suit.

                      Other key ideas developed in these early years included
                      the UPS Policy Book, issued to each employee and listing
                      over one hundred highly detailed policies. The company
                      banned employees’ relatives from being hired by the
                      company, halting any potential issues of nepotism. UPS
                      became highly decentralized, with power delegated into
                      regions, districts, and hubs. Jim required a policy of
                      informality, with everyone called by their first names.
                      Executives did not have private secretaries, and answered
                      their own phones. Their offices had open doors to anyone
                      in the company.

                      UPS focused intensely on efficiency—the best driving
                      routes, not making left turns if one could avoid them,
                      never backing up, holding the car keys in the right hand
                      for quick starts, and timing and measuring every aspect of
                      the enterprise. The company was understandably focused on
                      safety (today UPS has less than one accident per million
                      miles driven).

                      Such tight rules have been likened to the military; UPS is
                      one of the most disciplined organizations in the world.
                      This type of environment is not right for everyone, but
                      those who love it have found it empowering (because it
                      works) and enriching (in more ways than one). Jim adopted
                      a policy of promotion from within, and today many of the
                      top people at UPS started as drivers or package sorters,
                      and have been with the company over twenty-five years.
                      (Present UPS Chief Executive Officer David Abney began as
                      a Mississippi part-timer when he was nineteen.)

                      An important development in this time was Jim Casey’s
                      uncommon acceptance of trade unions. While he worked hard
                      to treat all his employees right, he saw the rise of the
                      unions and thought he could work with them. Gradually,
                      city by city, UPS’s drivers became members of the powerful
                      Teamsters’ Union. Most business leaders of the era hated
                      the unions and did everything they could to keep them out.
                      Ten years later General Motors and particularly Ford
                      fought unionization of their factories hard—and lost. Jim
                      felt differently. (In 2017, UPS employed 280,000 members
                      of the Teamsters’ Union, far more than any other company.)

                      Perhaps the most important change at UPS was Jim’s
                      decision to “share the wealth.” In 1927, consistent with
                      his regard for his associates, the company offered stock
                      in UPS at $15 a share to fifty-two key employees, all of
                      whom but three took advantage of the offer. The recipients
                      were allowed five years to pay for the stock. And they
                      could sell the stock back to the company at a price set
                      four times a year by the board of directors, prices which
                      would consistently rise over the years. One of those $15
                      shares has now (April 2018) become 16,000 shares worth
                      $1.8 million, a 13.7 percent compounded rate of return
                      over ninety-one years, not counting twice-a-year dividends
                      totaling 2–4 percent per year.

                      For seventy-two years, all UPS stock was owned by the
                      founders, their families and heirs, and other employees.
                      It became the largest employee-owned company in America.
                      It was not until 1999, sixteen years after Jim’s death,
                      that UPS sold shares to the general public, becoming a
                      “public company.” Today, over 70 percent of the
                      stockholder votes are held by UPS employees and heirs of
                      the founders.

                      Today’s UPS each year spends billions on health insurance
                      and pensions for both union and non-union employees. The
                      company was among the first to offer such benefits to its
                      employees, usually bearing the entire cost. A book could
                      be filled with all the incentive programs for managers and
                      discounted stock purchase and other benefits for all
                      employees, which continue to this day.

                      At Mac McCabe’s urging, UPS took a plunge into air
                      delivery, creating the nation’s first air parcel service,
                      United Air Express, in February 1929. The company
                      contracted with four passenger airlines to carry its
                      packages between Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, Los
                      Angeles, San Diego, Phoenix, and El Paso.

                      At the same time, Jim and his friends lusted after the big
                      New York City market, but they did not have the capital to
                      enter it. With the stock market booming and many mergers
                      taking place, the newly formed aviation giant
                      Curtiss-Wright (descended from the pioneering companies of
                      Glenn Curtiss and the Wright Brothers) offered to buy UPS,
                      including its new air service. In the fall of 1929,
                      Curtiss-Wright paid $2 million in cash and 600,000 shares
                      of Curtiss-Wright to buy UPS. UPS stockholders became
                      Curtiss-Wright stockholders. UPS used the $2 million to
                      enter New York and moved its headquarters there in 1930
                      (headquarters moved again, to Connecticut in 1975, and to
                      Atlanta in 1991). Jim and his partners were paid generous
                      annual salaries of $25,000 each and guaranteed management
                      control for five years.

                      But the new arrangement didn’t last five years: the stock
                      market crashed in October 1929 and the demand for a fast,
                      expensive air parcel service dried up. Jim and his
                      partners bought their company back and exchanged the
                      Curtiss-Wright stock for UPS shares. It took four years of
                      hard work to unwind the deal. Best of all, they did not
                      have to return the $2 million cash, which they used to
                      conquer the big New York delivery market. Soon UPS had 159
                      vehicles serving thirty-seven New York stores, delivering
                      anywhere within a fifty-mile radius of Manhattan.

                      twenty-two. Mac’s wife, Garnet, was inconsolable, and
                      bothered by Mac’s continuing obsession with work. At 2
                      a.m. on February 12, 1933, Garnet shot and killed her
                      husband in their posh New York apartment. (She then spent

                      Having developed city-wide retail delivery services in
                      many cities, UPS wanted to deliver into more remote areas

                      In 1952, Jim and his colleagues applied to the California
                      Public Utilities Commission for the right to carry
                      merchandise between Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay
                      Area, which they got in 1953. Due to regulatory
                      complexities, getting the rights to deliver overnight over
                      the same route required a separate application, which took
                      another three years to achieve.

                      From 1952 to 1986, in front of regulatory commissions and
                      in the courts, UPS spent an enormous amount of time,
                      money, and energy battling for territorial transportation
                      rights. Despite the desire of thousands of shipping
                      customers to have UPS service, their foes were powerful.
                      Entrenched local carriers fought them. The US Post Office,
                      paying few taxes and subsidized by the federal government,
                      fought them. Regulators defended the old order and took
                      months or years to decide cases.

                      Despite its long and excellent operating history in the
                      states of Washington and California, UPS did not achieve
                      full intrastate delivery rights in those two states until
                      1966. In 1967, it won rights to serve the southeastern
                      states. In 1971, UPS obtained intrastate rights in Oregon
                      and broad rights across the central United States. Access
                      to all the “lower forty-eight states” was achieved in
                      1975, the same year that Hawaii was added. Alaska joined
                      in 1977, giving UPS customers access to all fifty states.
                      The last holdout for intrastate rights was Texas, where
                      UPS finally beat the Railroad Commission of Texas (and the
                      companies it was protecting) in the courts in 1986.
                      Hundreds of potential customers petitioned for the change.

                      Congress passed the Motor Carrier Act of 1980, which
                      almost completely deregulated interstate trucking. In
                      1980, the US had 18,000 trucking companies, of which only
                      a handful had national operating rights. Within ten years
                      of the Act’s passage, America had 45,000 trucking
                      companies, of which 20,000 had national rights. The
                      Interstate Commerce Commission, which UPS had spent so
                      much time and money fighting, disappeared. Competition
                      arose, rates dropped, and service improved for all
                      customers.

                      Jim Casey was at the forefront in all of these battles.
                      Jim led UPS for fifty-five years. He continued as the
                      Chief Executive Officer of UPS until 1962, when he handed
                      over the reins at age seventy-four. Brother George had
                      died in 1957, leaving Jim as the sole surviving founder.
                      However, Jim remained on the board of directors and a
                      leader and inspiration for UPS almost until his death at
                      the age of ninety-five in 1983. When UPS achieved
                      forty-eight-state coverage in 1975, the
                      eighty-eight-year-old Casey could only say to his
                      associates, “But you know, we are only serving 5 percent
                      of the world’s population!” He wanted UPS to cover the
                      earth. The man’s ambition knew no ceiling.

                      Our “American Originals” series of short biographies has
                      covered some of the most impressive and focused men and
                      women in American history. Walt Disney and Estee Lauder
                      created lasting global brands. George Eastman created
                      Kodak, one of America’s greatest tech companies. Each of
                      these companies has changed in various ways since its
                      founder’s departure. The Disney company today is a far cry
                      from the firm Walt left behind, now owning networks like
                      ESPN and ABC. Kodak is a shadow of its former self.

                      UPS is unique in that it is a direct descendant of the
                      policies, values, and business of Jim Casey and his
                      friends. The massive company today still earns about 80
                      percent of its revenue from package delivery. The strict
                      military-like culture still lives. The policy of treating
                      people with respect and paying them well continues
                      unabated. “Never promise more than you can deliver”
                      remains the watchword of this huge enterprise.

                      In 2017, UPS delivered over 19 million packages a day,
                      totaling 5.1 billion for the year. UPS’s 454,000
                      well-treated and well-paid employees make it one of the
                      world’s largest private company employers. 2017 revenues
                      totaled $65.9 billion, making it the largest
                      non-government transportation company on earth. At a
                      market capitalization of about $100 billion, it is also
                      the most valuable transportation company, above any
                      airline or railroad. Despite paying what many would
                      consider excessive salaries and hourly rates, the company
                      offers reasonable prices and yet still made a profit of
                      $4.9 billion after taxes in 2017. These numbers are
                      remarkable by any standard.

                      Most of the world’s people are now familiar with UPS’s
                      brown vehicles and brown uniforms. UPS operates about
                      118,000 vehicles. It generates $33.9 billion in annual
                      revenue from its American trucking operations, one-third
                      more than FedEx and almost five times as much as the next
                      biggest trucking company, J. B. Hunt. UPS’s 280,000
                      hard-working Teamster drivers receive outstanding pay and
                      benefits, with many making over $100,000 per year
                      including holiday overtime. Over 60 percent of UPS’s
                      revenue is spent on employee compensation and benefits.

                      After the rise of FedEx (founded in 1973), UPS became
                      serious about air delivery, and in 1981 began to build its
                      own global airline. The 720 global destinations UPS serves
                      equal almost double the runners-up: 375 at FedEx and 373
                      at United. In 2016, UPS Air carried 11.2 million
                      ton-kilometers of freight (one ton carried one kilometer),
                      making it the third largest air cargo company. UPS’s
                      largest aviation hub at Louisville, Kentucky, is called
                      “Worldport.” Here, UPS aircraft make three hundred
                      arrivals and departures daily. Worldport has 33,000
                      conveyors stretching 155 miles in the 5.2-million
                      square-foot facility. The more than 30,000 workers at
                      Worldport use this machinery to sort up to 416,000
                      packages an hour—two million on a typical night shift and
                      up to four million during the Christmas holiday season.
                      Many of those night workers are students who work part
                      time—they are eligible for 100 percent paid tuition at the
                      University of Louisville’s Metropolitan College. Over
                      3,000 students take advantage of this UPS benefit.

                      Proceeding from Jim Casey’s obsession with efficient
                      service, today UPS provides “logistics” services to
                      customers around the world—in 220 countries. In
                      Louisville, UPS employees repair computers and pack
                      cameras for large customers. UPS uses the latest
                      technologies and techniques to get the job done—from using
                      advanced routing software to being one of the US’s largest
                      customers of the railroads (for hauls over five hundred
                      miles). The giant Chicago Area Consolidation Hub each day
                      handles 92 trains of package containers. This hub employs
                      over 5,000 people in its 1.5 million square feet.

                      The Chicago and Louisville operations are only two of over

                      It can be hard to imagine the challenges of running such a

                      and Company, and others may find having fifty or five
                      hundred locations challenging. Leading, managing,
                      monitoring, and communicating with over 400,000 people in
                      over 2,000 locations requires tremendous managerial skills
                      and systems. To accomplish this consistently and
                      profitably, for 111 years, is one of the miracles of
                      modern life.

                      Nobody had to “revisit” his emphasis on openness and
                      sharing. Nobody had to undo his conveyors and systems.

                      In 1948, he and his siblings used their UPS stock to set
                      up the Annie E. Casey Foundation to honor their mother.
                      Focused on children with tremendous challenges—such as
                      those who have been in and out of multiple foster
                      homes—today this foundation has $2.5 billion in assets,
                      and hands out well over $100 million per year. Those
                      assets still include over $300 million worth of UPS stock.

                      others, unrelated to UPS. Other foundations help finance
                      college for the children of UPS employees and promote many

                      This story above all else proves that “determined men,
                      working together, can do anything.” The history of UPS
                      proves that one (enormous) company can serve the public,
                      serve its employees, and serve its stockholders at the
                      same time. It proves that a clear, correct, foresighted
                      vision need not be “reinvented” with each passing fad.
                      That great companies do not have to be “sexy” or at the
                      leading edge of science; that there is potential in the
                      most mundane of tasks. Even if most Americans have never
                      heard of Jim Casey or thought about what UPS does for
                      them, this story proves that one man, with the right
                      associates, can have a large and lasting impact in making
                      our society productive and prosperous.

                      Much has been written about the Vickrey auction from a
                      game theoretic perspective — namely that it incentivizes
                      bidders to ignore other bidders and simply state their own
                      true value — but the auction has other benefits for an
                      ongoing luxury keyboard brand:

                      (but attracts customers) and they profit when customers
                      purchase high-margin “add-ons”. While it’s not obvious how

                      limitations cannot explain the behavior of niche keyboard

                      My gut feeling is that, in general, purchasing power
                      correlates inversely with time spent commenting on Reddit,
                      so creators should spend more time developing other
                      marketing channels. But if auctions allow creators to
                      capture “super-fan” dollars, should they be spending{" "}

                      The keyboard group buy FOMO reminds me of another market
                      with hyped upcoming releases, limited availability, and
                      obsessive collectors: Sneakerheads. However in that case,
                      sneaker manufacturers profit (I assume) not from the
                      limited-run sneakers directly, but from the “halo effect”
                      that boosts sales of their mainstream product lines. As
                      far as I can tell, no keyboard creators are pursuing this
                      strategy — all the online stores I’ve seen tend to have a
                      lot of (sold out) kits at the same price level.

                      The argument behind diversification is that there is too
                      much randomness in the world to have an edge based on
                      skill.

                      While there is unquestionably some truth to the idea that
                      the world is often too random to literally make just one
                      bet, the widely held assumption that diversification is a
                      free lunch is just plain wrong. Just as there is benefit
                      to be derived from diversification with respect to risk,
                      there is a cost, too — that of losing whatever edge you
                      might have been able to gain from skill. Diversification
                      is a strategy to regress to the mean — that is, to be
                      average. For those pursuing excellence, focus is a far
                      better strategy.

                      to be known as regression to the mean. I prefer Galton’s

                      Figure 1 shows the tension between the “edge” gained by
                      focus (y axis) and the gains from making numerous “bets”
                      (x axis). Conventional wisdom has it that any particular
                      bet you make may earn returns greater than or less than
                      the mean — as the number of bets approaches 100 percent of
                      possible bets, you end up with the mean by definition.
                      Many investment strategies explicitly seek to be average;
                      index funds do so by algorithmically approximating entire
                      indices. If you lack the knowledge or time to do the work
                      yourself, and your goal is simply wealth preservation,
                      such a strategy may in fact make sense.

                      However, if you’re trying to earn excess returns or build
                      a great product, diversification is the enemy. In Figure 2
                      I have offered an alternative visual of how a
                      knowledgeable investor might perform. I believe an
                      investor can leverage knowledge he has about a particular
                      industry or company to beat the average on a risk-adjusted
                      basis. There is still uncontrollable risk, so I’m not
                      arguing that an investor should invest in just one stock.
                      On the other hand, there is a cost that comes with the
                      security of diversification; you pay for that insurance.
                      Too much, in fact.

                        the right way to build a product, to build a company —
                        and to be an exceptional investor. Clearly even focused
                        investors make a few bets; you can make a few very
                        well-researched bets per year. But can you really make
                        30 bets per year, per person, and keep coming out a
                        winner? Great entrepreneurs iterate, but my experience
                        with great entrepreneurs is that there’s usually an
                        ethos and sense of clarity behind what they’re trying to
                        accomplish. It’s not about{" "}

                      The problem with diversification is that the effort
                      required to master something is so great that every spare
                      neuron spent on something else gives the person with focus
                      an upper hand. Diversification is attractive because it’s
                      safe and requires little effort.

                      number of investment vehicles, which involves significant
                      research before and oversight after an investment (both of

                      Focus is not inconsistent with intellectual honesty. It
                      does not mean ignoring feedback. It simply means that your
                      bets are well selected and that your conviction to find a
                      way to make something work is high enough to overcome the
                      inevitable hurdles of building a company, product or

                      Making few bets forces you to make hard decisions. It’s
                      extremely hard to measure the value of something against

                      Proponents of diversification argue that it takes the edge
                      off of making a mistake. That would be a good argument if
                      people acted the same way independent of their ownership
                      in an outcome, but human beings do alter their behavior
                      based on how much skin they have in the game. When costs
                      and benefits are divided amongst too many people,
                      accountability is lost. Excessive diversification makes
                      participants passive, dependent on the actions of others
                      who are dependent on the actions of others, and so on. It

                      The intention of the course is to examine many of the
                      issues associated with optimizing product-market fit.
                      Without a tight product-market fit, a startup’s service
                      will not be able to break through the market’s
                      gravitational forces that strongly favor existing
                      solutions. With tight product-market fit, however, it is
                      more likely that a company will achieve repeatable and
                      growing sales success.

                      Andy is co-founder and CEO of Wealthfront, an automated
                      investment service firm based in Redwood City. He had
                      previously been the executive chairman of the company
                      after stepping down as CEO, but then returned to the CEO
                      role in 2016. Rachleff also co-founded Benchmark Capital
                      in 1995, a top-tier venture capital firm with early
                      investments in Snapchat, Uber, OpenTable, and Twitter.
                      Rachleff himself led investments in Blue Coat Systems and
                      Juniper Networks.

                      Most successful new markets begin with a market-sensitive
                      technologist recognizing an inflection point that enables
                      a new kind of product. The next question becomes: “who
                      wants to buy my product?” Start with the product and
                      search for the market as opposed to vice versa. Evaluating
                      a market trying to find holes and developing solutions for
                      those problems will lead to mundane outcomes.

                      In order to increase the likelihood of success, a startup
                      should start with an MVP to test a value hypothesis. A
                      value hypothesis includes the features you need to build
                      (what), the audience that is likely to care (who), and the
                      business model that will compel your audience to buy your
                      product (how). A founder’s first hypothesis will likely
                      prove incorrect. Iteration through experiments is
                      necessary before product-market fit is reached.

                      Product-market fit really means finding a group of
                      customers who are desperate for your product. If they
                      aren’t desperate, it means there is likely a good
                      alternative. If customers aren’t desperate for your
                      product, look for a new group that is desperate instead of
                      iterating your product to find what those people want.

                      consensus or non-consensus. Of course, you won’t make any

                      As an entrepreneur, being non-consensus and right is the
                      only way to build a legendary company. Non-consensus
                      entrepreneurs resist the temptation to herd into markets
                      made popular by high-profile successes. The benefit of
                      this approach is that they have enough time to test,
                      iterate, and learn before competitors enter.

                      Every technology has an adoption lifecycle. The chasm lies
                      between early adopters (those who are willing to take a
                      chance on a new product if it solves a burning pain) and
                      the early majority (the largest market segment). To cross
                      the chasm, startups must first dominate a niche or create
                      a beachhead and then expand from a position of strength.
                      Too often, startups try to skip the early adopter stage
                      and move to early majority. The issue is that the early
                      majority requires references, and they won’t buy the
                      product no matter how valuable it is without them.

                      At Wealthfront, Andy’s team first developed a product that
                      appealed to a small, passionate audience: young people who
                      work in technology. These users cared more about the
                      quality of the user experience than assets under
                      management. Initial focus was on engineers at Facebook,
                      then engineers at LinkedIn, then many other successful
                      technology companies through word of mouth. Wealthfront
                      established strength within one segment, then built a
                      whole product and used references to expand to adjacent
                      markets.

                      I got the 2nd shot of my Pfizer vaccine in May, a little
                      more than 1 year after the United States went into a full
                      lockdown. On the one hand, it felt like an incredibly long
                      time, but the vaccine has come faster than anybody could
                      have realistically imagined. The speed of the COVID
                      vaccine is one of the great miracles of modern technology.

                      In April 2020 in the height of the pandemic, New York
                      Times reporter Stuart Thompson produced an interactive
                      article to discuss the “realistic” timeline of the COVID
                      vaccine. At that time, while Dr. Fauci among others were
                      publicly touting a goal timeline of August 2021, his
                      research had shown the “typical” timeline would be
                      November 2033. He even created a number of switches on
                      various things which could accelerate the timeline, but if
                      you play with it, the fastest you can get the vaccine
                      based on the simulation is 2023.

                      Now, what actually happened was even faster than the
                      August 2021 timeline, and many of us received two shots in
                      May 2021. So was Thompson just being ridiculously
                      pessimistic? Did he not know what he was talking about at
                      all? Not really—he produced his article after interviewing
                      multiple vaccine experts, and he even shows the histogram
                      of how long it took for other vaccines to be developed—it
                      usually takes over a decade!

                      Based on all the data that Thompson presented, most
                      reasonable readers would actually conclude that it was
                      Fauci who was being crazy. Humanity has never created a
                      vaccine in under a decade, and public officials are
                      telling us that it’ll take a year?

                      But Fauci was right. In fact, he was slightly pessimistic
                      (August 2021 vs April 2021). To have properly predicted
                      the timeline in this case, you would’ve had to have bet on
                      the fact that the mRNA vaccine technology was going to
                      work, which in early 2020 was viewed as experimental.
                      Moderna, a company built and founded in 2010 on the
                      technology, didn’t have a successful drug until the COVID
                      vaccine.

                      well. It’s not hard to find examples of experts’

                      There’s a peculiar thing where oftentimes it’s the wildly
                      optimistic predictions that end up being right. Such

                      The maker of these optimistic predictions will never be
                      able to chart the path in which their prediction will come
                      true, or even if they tried, that path will be wrong. But,
                      the prediction will end up being right because they are
                      properly betting on unknown unknowns. These future moments

                      should not be surprising that they will happen.

                      On the other hand, making long-term predictions about the

                        Accurately predicting the future relies on betting on
                        unknown unknowns. It’s impossible to say what these
                        breakthroughs will be, but it’s almost a certainty that
                        they will happen.

                      ​This is a great example of betting on unknown unknowns.
                      When Moore first formulated it in 1965, we did not know
                      all of the innovations or feats of engineering that would
                      have enabled this trend for the next 55 years. But, Moore
                      was right, and every year we have continued to make
                      advancements in research to continue to drive meaningful
                      improvements.

                      The divergence between prediction and reality has
                      continued, where in 2010 there were increasingly opinions
                      from experts that Moore’s law was slowing or over. But, in
                      line with the unstoppable power of unknown unknowns, we
                      are continuing to keep pace into 2021.

                      Another shocking recent example was GPT-3 from OpenAI. For
                      a long time, members of the OpenAI team were insistent
                      that the long-term goal of AGI was going to be possible,
                      and to many in the industry that seemed a little crazy.
                      Then in 2020, they showed incredible capabilities with
                      GPT-3, particularly in zero-shot and few-shot
                      learning—capabilities which most researchers might have
                      said we weren’t close to. To many, this was the first real
                      glimpse at AGI.​

                      These results would not have been possible had it not been
                      for the Transformer model which came out of Google in
                      2017. This “unknown unknown” was difficult to predict the
                      exact form of in 2015 when OpenAI first got started, but
                      enabled a gain of two orders of magnitude on training
                      efficiency and made the GPT-3 results possible. Betting on
                      unknown unknowns worked out well.

                      The story of Amazon and AWS is probably one of the
                      greatest stories of modern business, and if it were to
                      happen in a TV show, the narrative would likely be
                      criticized for jumping the shark and being unrealistic.
                      What started as an online bookstore then became the
                      largest internet marketplace in America, and then became
                      the largest enterprise company in the world.

                      To have properly predicted the meteoric rise and growth of
                      Amazon, you could have either been blindly optimistic, or
                      you could have fallen in line with the pundits and been
                      pessimistic on the stock. As a true unknown unknown,
                      Amazon invented AWS which is now significantly more
                      profitable than Amazon.com, and is responsible for nearly
                      half of Amazon’s market cap.

                      At Scale, we’ve discovered unknown unknowns many times,
                      and chances are that we will discover them again in the
                      future. The discovery and deployment of technology to our
                      annotation systems have allowed us to achieve
                      significantly higher quality and lower costs, which have
                      allowed us to continue to scale and compete across both
                      dimensions. At the same time, we’ve built new products

                      As a final caveat, you cannot always bet on unknown
                      unknowns. Chances are that JC Penney is not going to
                      magically become one of the most valuable stocks of the
                      decade. If you had to bet on that one, the correct bet is
                      probably that they will continue to be more and more
                      irrelevant over time.

                      You can only bet on unknown unknowns near the frontiers of
                      human tenacity and creativity. Towards the tail
                      distributions on both traits, unexpected tail events start
                      to happen that dominate everything else. The problem with
                      JC Penney isn’t that the department store business is a
                      bad business (you could argue that the online bookstore
                      business for Amazon was also a bad business). The problem
                      is that JC Penney doesn’t have a high density of people
                      who are either deeply tenacious or deeply creative. The
                      unknown unknowns at JC Penney are 1,000 times less likely
                      than at Amazon, so you likely shouldn’t be betting on
                      them.

                      When you have groups of people who are especially
                      tenacious and especially creative, magic happens.
                      Amazonians had to be far more tenacious than competitors,
                      otherwise they would die. Amazon’s tenacity has
                      perpetuated into Amazon being one perhaps the most
                      innovative company in the world, continuing to invent and
                      enter new markets at a breakneck pace. At its core, the
                      reason to bet on Amazon is their corporate tenacity, and
                      therefore inventiveness.

                      A bold vision can sometimes be confused with arrogance or
                      hubris, and sure enough, sometimes that’s how it ends up
                      looking. Betting on unknown unknowns still requires a deep
                      ability to execute. But Scale has a track record of
                      delivering unknown unknowns, and it would be the wrong bet
                      to think that will stop.

                      An interesting pattern seems to recur across the career of
                      great scientists - an annus mirabilis (miracle year) in
                      which they make multiple seemingly independent
                      breakthroughs in the span of a single year or two.

                      Einstein had his annus mirabilis in 1905. While he was
                      still a patent clerk, he wrote four papers that
                      revolutionized our understanding of the photoelectric
                      effect, Brownian motion, and special relativity.

                      Newton’s annus mirabilis came to him between 1665 and
                      1666, when Cambridge responded to the Bubonic plague by
                      sending its students home to quarantine. In that time,
                      Newton, aged 22, discovered the theory of gravity along
                      with the language of calculus in which he expressed it. He
                      recalled of that year:

                      into a full operating system called Linux. That was his

                      Writers also seem to have miracle years. Just recently,
                      the popular fantasy author Brandon Sanderson announced
                      that in the year or two since the pandemic began, he has
                      secretly written five extra novels in addition to the ones
                      he was already publicly writing. The kickstarter to access
                      these secret novels has already reached 40 million
                      dollars.

                      If great discoveries are randomly distributed across the
                      career of a scientist, then with some non-negligible
                      probability, they will fall within a year of each other.
                      Which means that out of hundreds of great scientists, by
                      dint of coincidence, a few will have a miracle year.

                      found a new paradigm, and they got to spend a year
                      gobbling up all the important low hanging discoveries
                      before the competition caught on.

                      Perhaps there’s a brief window in a person’s life where he
                      has the intelligence, curiosity, and freedom of youth but
                      also the skills and knowledge of age. These conditions
                      only coincide at some point in a someone’s twenties. It
                      wouldn’t be surprising if the combination of fluid
                      intelligence (which declines precipitously after your 20s)
                      and crystalized intelligence (which accumulates slowly up
                      till your 50s and 60s) is highest during this time.

                      Von Nuemann showed remarkable productivity in his late
                      twenties. Between 1927 and 1929, he published nearly one
                      major paper a month. But after growing worried about the
                      trend of politics in Germany, he left for Princeton’s
                      Institute for Advanced Studies. Feynman said of this

                      I can’t disagree with any one of these uses of von
                      Neumman’s time individually. I can’t say that he should
                      not have had a family, that he should not have helped us
                      win World War 2, or that he should not have helped advise
                      government research and strategy regarding the Cold War.
                      But I find it tragic that, collectively, these obligation
                      sapped away decades out of the short life of the greatest
                      known genius in history and prevented him from working on
                      the basic theoretical research at which he was clearly

                      There are so many distractions that come from being
                      successful. The university wants you to become department
                      head and serve on a committee or two. Some government
                      panel wants you to advise of a growing security threat.
                      Now you’re getting handsome offers from startups looking
                      for advisers, publishers looking for new pop sci books,
                      and online course platforms looking for celebrity
                      teachers. A new paper comes out claiming to demolish a
                      prominent result of yours from a decade ago, and you must
                      respond. And then there’s aging itself, which brings
                      family, dullness, and complacency.

                      made a point of avoiding scientifically irrelevant

                      important results decade after decade. In response to a

                      their lives. I don’t know enough about them to figure out
                      what they had in common, but I would guess that they were
                      able to avoid getting conscripted for these kinds of

                      years keep showing up in the lives of great scientists,

                      intensely concentrated on the right problems, and open to

                      Given how many of the great scientific discoveries have
                      come about during miracle years, we should do everything
                      we can to help smart 20-somethings have an annus
                      mirabilis. We should free them up from rote menial work,
                      prevent them from being too exposed to the current
                      paradigm, and give them the freedom to explore far fetched
                      ideas without arbitrary deadlines or time consuming
                      obligations. It’s a bit depressing that I have just
                      described the opposite of the modern PhD program.

                        Although Stephen Malina offered an interesting
                        alternative hypothesis as a comment on a draft on this
                        post. He suggests that perhaps we have flipped the
                        causality around here, and these scientists are so
                        famous because they had a memorable annus mirabilis. I
                        don’t think this is true - Einstein became widely known
                        of after he developed general relativity, which was much
                        after his 1905 annus mirabilis. And Newton and Darwin
                        didn’t even release their discoveries until long after
                        their early-20s science spree.{" "}

                        The students seem highly aware of how the world has
                        changed (as the sampling of views in this article shows).
                        In the spring, Harvard Business School’s graduating class
                        asked HBS professor Clay Christensen to address them—but
                        not on how to apply his principles and thinking to their
                        post-HBS careers. The students wanted to know how to apply
                        them to their personal lives. He shared with them a set of
                        guidelines that have helped him find meaning in his own
                        life. Though Christensen’s thinking comes from his deep
                        religious faith, we believe that these are strategies
                        anyone can use. And so we asked him to share them with the
                        readers of HBR.

                      , I got a call from Andrew Grove, then the chairman of
                      Intel. He had read one of my early papers about disruptive
                      technology, and he asked if I could talk to his direct
                      reports and explain my research and what it implied for
                      Intel. Excited, I flew to Silicon Valley and showed up at
                      the appointed time, only to have Grove say, “Look, stuff has
                      happened. We have only 10 minutes for you. Tell us what your
                      model of disruption means for Intel.” I said that I
                      couldn’t—that I needed a full 30 minutes to explain the
                      model, because only with it as context would any comments
                      about Intel make sense. Ten minutes into my explanation,
                      Grove interrupted: “Look, I’ve got your model. Just tell us
                      what it means for Intel.”

                      I insisted that I needed 10 more minutes to describe how the
                      process of disruption had worked its way through a very
                      different industry, steel, so that he and his team could
                      understand how disruption worked. I told the story of how
                      Nucor and other steel minimills had begun by attacking the
                      lowest end of the market—steel reinforcing bars, or
                      rebar—and later moved up toward the high end, undercutting
                      the traditional steel mills.

                      When I finished the minimill story, Grove said, “OK, I get
                      it. What it means for Intel is…,” and then went on to
                      articulate what would become the company’s strategy for
                      going to the bottom of the market to launch the Celeron
                      processor.

                      I’ve thought about that a million times since. If I had been
                      suckered into telling Andy Grove what he should think about
                      the microprocessor business, I’d have been killed. But
                      instead of telling him what to think, I taught him how to
                      think—and then he reached what I felt was the correct
                      decision on his own.

                      That experience had a profound influence on me. When people
                      ask what I think they should do, I rarely answer their
                      question directly. Instead, I run the question aloud through
                      one of my models. I’ll describe how the process in the model
                      worked its way through an industry quite different from
                      their own. And then, more often than not, they’ll say, “OK,
                      I get it.” And they’ll answer their own question more
                      insightfully than I could have.

                      My class at HBS is structured to help my students understand
                      what good management theory is and how it is built. To that
                      backbone I attach different models or theories that help
                      students think about the various dimensions of a general
                      manager’s job in stimulating innovation and growth. In each
                      session we look at one company through the lenses of those
                      theories—using them to explain how the company got into its
                      situation and to examine what managerial actions will yield
                      the needed results.

                      On the last day of class, I ask my students to turn those
                      theoretical lenses on themselves, to find cogent answers to
                      three questions: First, how can I be sure that I’ll be happy
                      in my career? Second, how can I be sure that my
                      relationships with my spouse and my family become an
                      enduring source of happiness? Third, how can I be sure I’ll
                      stay out of jail? Though the last question sounds
                      lighthearted, it’s not. Two of the 32 people in my Rhodes
                      scholar class spent time in jail. Jeff Skilling of Enron
                      fame was a classmate of mine at HBS. These were good
                      guys—but something in their lives sent them off in the wrong
                      direction.

                      As the students discuss the answers to these questions, I
                      open my own life to them as a case study of sorts, to
                      illustrate how they can use the theories from our course to
                      guide their life decisions.

                      One of the theories that gives great insight on the first
                      question—how to be sure we find happiness in our careers—is
                      from Frederick Herzberg, who asserts that the powerful
                      motivator in our lives isn’t money; it’s the opportunity to
                      learn, grow in responsibilities, contribute to others, and
                      be recognized for achievements. I tell the students about a
                      vision of sorts I had while I was running the company I
                      founded before becoming an academic. In my mind’s eye I saw
                      one of my managers leave for work one morning with a
                      relatively strong level of self-esteem. Then I pictured her
                      driving home to her family 10 hours later, feeling
                      unappreciated, frustrated, underutilized, and demeaned. I
                      imagined how profoundly her lowered self-esteem affected the
                      way she interacted with her children. The vision in my mind
                      then fast-forwarded to another day, when she drove home with
                      greater self-esteem—feeling that she had learned a lot, been
                      recognized for achieving valuable things, and played a
                      significant role in the success of some important
                      initiatives. I then imagined how positively that affected
                      her as a spouse and a parent. My conclusion: Management is
                      the most noble of professions if it’s practiced well. No
                      other occupation offers as many ways to help others learn
                      and grow, take responsibility and be recognized for
                      achievement, and contribute to the success of a team. More
                      and more MBA students come to school thinking that a career
                      in business means buying, selling, and investing in
                      companies. That’s unfortunate. Doing deals doesn’t yield the
                      deep rewards that come from building up people.

                      A theory that is helpful in answering the second
                      question—How can I ensure that my relationship with my
                      family proves to be an enduring source of
                      happiness?—concerns how strategy is defined and implemented.
                      Its primary insight is that a company’s strategy is
                      determined by the types of initiatives that management
                      invests in. If a company’s resource allocation process is
                      not managed masterfully, what emerges from it can be very
                      different from what management intended. Because companies’
                      decision-making systems are designed to steer investments to
                      initiatives that offer the most tangible and immediate
                      returns, companies shortchange investments in initiatives
                      that are crucial to their long-term strategies.

                      Over the years I’ve watched the fates of my HBS classmates
                      from 1979 unfold; I’ve seen more and more of them come to
                      reunions unhappy, divorced, and alienated from their
                      children. I can guarantee you that not a single one of them
                      graduated with the deliberate strategy of getting divorced
                      and raising children who would become estranged from them.
                      And yet a shocking number of them implemented that strategy.
                      The reason? They didn’t keep the purpose of their lives
                      front and center as they decided how to spend their time,
                      talents, and energy.

                      It’s quite startling that a significant fraction of the 900
                      students that HBS draws each year from the world’s best have
                      given little thought to the purpose of their lives. I tell
                      the students that HBS might be one of their last chances to
                      reflect deeply on that question. If they think that they’ll
                      have more time and energy to reflect later, they’re nuts,
                      because life only gets more demanding: You take on a
                      mortgage; you’re working 70 hours a week; you have a spouse
                      and children.

                      For me, having a clear purpose in my life has been
                      essential. But it was something I had to think long and hard
                      about before I understood it. When I was a Rhodes scholar, I
                      was in a very demanding academic program, trying to cram an
                      extra year’s worth of work into my time at Oxford. I decided
                      to spend an hour every night reading, thinking, and praying
                      about why God put me on this earth. That was a very
                      challenging commitment to keep, because every hour I spent
                      doing that, I wasn’t studying applied econometrics. I was
                      conflicted about whether I could really afford to take that
                      time away from my studies, but I stuck with it—and
                      ultimately figured out the purpose of my life.

                      Had I instead spent that hour each day learning the latest
                      techniques for mastering the problems of autocorrelation in
                      regression analysis, I would have badly misspent my life. I
                      apply the tools of econometrics a few times a year, but I
                      apply my knowledge of the purpose of my life every day. It’s
                      the single most useful thing I’ve ever learned. I promise my
                      students that if they take the time to figure out their life
                      purpose, they’ll look back on it as the most important thing
                      they discovered at HBS. If they don’t figure it out, they
                      will just sail off without a rudder and get buffeted in the
                      very rough seas of life. Clarity about their purpose will
                      trump knowledge of activity-based costing, balanced
                      scorecards, core competence, disruptive innovation, the four
                      Ps, and the five forces.

                      My purpose grew out of my religious faith, but faith isn’t
                      the only thing that gives people direction. For example, one
                      of my former students decided that his purpose was to bring
                      honesty and economic prosperity to his country and to raise
                      children who were as capably committed to this cause, and to
                      each other, as he was. His purpose is focused on family and
                      others—as mine is.

                      I have a bunch of “businesses” that compete for these
                      resources: I’m trying to have a rewarding relationship with
                      my wife, raise great kids, contribute to my community,
                      succeed in my career, contribute to my church, and so on.
                      And I have exactly the same problem that a corporation does.
                      I have a limited amount of time and energy and talent. How
                      much do I devote to each of these pursuits?

                      Allocation choices can make your life turn out to be very
                      different from what you intended. Sometimes that’s good:
                      Opportunities that you never planned for emerge. But if you
                      misinvest your resources, the outcome can be bad. As I think
                      about my former classmates who inadvertently invested for
                      lives of hollow unhappiness, I can’t help believing that
                      their troubles relate right back to a short-term
                      perspective.

                      When people who have a high need for achievement—and that
                      includes all Harvard Business School graduates—have an extra
                      half hour of time or an extra ounce of energy, they’ll
                      unconsciously allocate it to activities that yield the most
                      tangible accomplishments. And our careers provide the most
                      concrete evidence that we’re moving forward. You ship a
                      product, finish a design, complete a presentation, close a
                      sale, teach a class, publish a paper, get paid, get
                      promoted. In contrast, investing time and energy in your
                      relationship with your spouse and children typically doesn’t
                      offer that same immediate sense of achievement. Kids
                      misbehave every day. It’s really not until 20 years down the
                      road that you can put your hands on your hips and say, “I
                      raised a good son or a good daughter.” You can neglect your
                      relationship with your spouse, and on a day-to-day basis, it
                      doesn’t seem as if things are deteriorating. People who are
                      driven to excel have this unconscious propensity to
                      underinvest in their families and overinvest in their
                      careers—even though intimate and loving relationships with
                      their families are the most powerful and enduring source of
                      happiness.

                      If you study the root causes of business disasters, over and
                      over you’ll find this predisposition toward endeavors that
                      offer immediate gratification. If you look at personal lives
                      through that lens, you’ll see the same stunning and sobering
                      pattern: people allocating fewer and fewer resources to the
                      things they would have once said mattered most.

                      There’s an important model in our class called the Tools of
                      Cooperation, which basically says that being a visionary
                      manager isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. It’s one thing to
                      see into the foggy future with acuity and chart the course
                      corrections that the company must make. But it’s quite
                      another to persuade employees who might not see the changes
                      ahead to line up and work cooperatively to take the company
                      in that new direction. Knowing what tools to wield to elicit
                      the needed cooperation is a critical managerial skill.

                      The theory arrays these tools along two dimensions—the
                      extent to which members of the organization agree on what
                      they want from their participation in the enterprise, and
                      the extent to which they agree on what actions will produce
                      the desired results. When there is little agreement on both
                      axes, you have to use “power tools”—coercion, threats,
                      punishment, and so on—to secure cooperation. Many companies
                      start in this quadrant, which is why the founding executive
                      team must play such an assertive role in defining what must
                      be done and how. If employees’ ways of working together to
                      address those tasks succeed over and over, consensus begins
                      to form. MIT’s Edgar Schein has described this process as
                      the mechanism by which a culture is built. Ultimately,
                      people don’t even think about whether their way of doing
                      things yields success. They embrace priorities and follow
                      procedures by instinct and assumption rather than by
                      explicit decision—which means that they’ve created a
                      culture. Culture, in compelling but unspoken ways, dictates
                      the proven, acceptable methods by which members of the group
                      address recurrent problems. And culture defines the priority
                      given to different types of problems. It can be a powerful
                      management tool.

                      In using this model to address the question, How can I be
                      sure that my family becomes an enduring source of
                      happiness?, my students quickly see that the simplest tools
                      that parents can wield to elicit cooperation from children
                      are power tools. But there comes a point during the teen
                      years when power tools no longer work. At that point parents
                      start wishing that they had begun working with their
                      children at a very young age to build a culture at home in
                      which children instinctively behave respectfully toward one
                      another, obey their parents, and choose the right thing to
                      do. Families have cultures, just as companies do. Those
                      cultures can be built consciously or evolve inadvertently.

                      If you want your kids to have strong self-esteem and
                      confidence that they can solve hard problems, those
                      qualities won’t magically materialize in high school. You
                      have to design them into your family’s culture—and you have
                      to think about this very early on. Like employees, children
                      build self-esteem by doing things that are hard and learning
                      what works.

                      We’re taught in finance and economics that in evaluating
                      alternative investments, we should ignore sunk and fixed
                      costs, and instead base decisions on the marginal costs and
                      marginal revenues that each alternative entails. We learn in
                      our course that this doctrine biases companies to leverage
                      what they have put in place to succeed in the past, instead
                      of guiding them to create the capabilities they’ll need in
                      the future. If we knew the future would be exactly the same
                      as the past, that approach would be fine. But if the
                      future’s different—and it almost always is—then it’s the
                      wrong thing to do.

                      This theory addresses the third question I discuss with my
                      students—how to live a life of integrity (stay out of jail).
                      Unconsciously, we often employ the marginal cost doctrine in
                      our personal lives when we choose between right and wrong. A
                      voice in our head says, “Look, I know that as a general
                      rule, most people shouldn’t do this. But in this particular
                      extenuating circumstance, just this once, it’s OK.” The
                      marginal cost of doing something wrong “just this once”
                      always seems alluringly low. It suckers you in, and you
                      don’t ever look at where that path ultimately is headed and
                      at the full costs that the choice entails. Justification for
                      infidelity and dishonesty in all their manifestations lies
                      in the marginal cost economics of “just this once.”

                      I’d like to share a story about how I came to understand the
                      potential damage of “just this once” in my own life. I
                      played on the Oxford University varsity basketball team. We
                      worked our tails off and finished the season undefeated. The
                      guys on the team were the best friends I’ve ever had in my
                      life. We got to the British equivalent of the NCAA
                      tournament—and made it to the final four. It turned out the
                      championship game was scheduled to be played on a Sunday. I
                      had made a personal commitment to God at age 16 that I would
                      never play ball on Sunday. So I went to the coach and
                      explained my problem. He was incredulous. My teammates were,
                      too, because I was the starting center. Every one of the
                      guys on the team came to me and said, “You’ve got to play.
                      Can’t you break the rule just this one time?”

                      I’m a deeply religious man, so I went away and prayed about
                      what I should do. I got a very clear feeling that I
                      shouldn’t break my commitment—so I didn’t play in the
                      championship game.

                      In many ways that was a small decision—involving one of
                      several thousand Sundays in my life. In theory, surely I
                      could have crossed over the line just that one time and then
                      not done it again. But looking back on it, resisting the
                      temptation whose logic was “In this extenuating
                      circumstance, just this once, it’s OK” has proven to be one
                      of the most important decisions of my life. Why? My life has
                      been one unending stream of extenuating circumstances. Had I
                      crossed the line that one time, I would have done it over
                      and over in the years that followed.

                      The lesson I learned from this is that it’s easier to hold
                      to your principles 100% of the time than it is to hold to
                      them 98% of the time. If you give in to “just this once,”
                      based on a marginal cost analysis, as some of my former
                      classmates have done, you’ll regret where you end up. You’ve
                      got to define for yourself what you stand for and draw the
                      line in a safe place.

                      I got this insight when I was asked to teach a class on
                      humility at Harvard College. I asked all the students to
                      describe the most humble person they knew. One
                      characteristic of these humble people stood out: They had a
                      high level of self-esteem. They knew who they were, and they
                      felt good about who they were. We also decided that humility
                      was defined not by self-deprecating behavior or attitudes
                      but by the esteem with which you regard others. Good
                      behavior flows naturally from that kind of humility. For
                      example, you would never steal from someone, because you
                      respect that person too much. You’d never lie to someone,
                      either.

                      It’s crucial to take a sense of humility into the world. By
                      the time you make it to a top graduate school, almost all
                      your learning has come from people who are smarter and more
                      experienced than you: parents, teachers, bosses. But once
                      you’ve finished at Harvard Business School or any other top
                      academic institution, the vast majority of people you’ll
                      interact with on a day-to-day basis may not be smarter than
                      you. And if your attitude is that only smarter people have
                      something to teach you, your learning opportunities will be
                      very limited. But if you have a humble eagerness to learn
                      something from everybody, your learning opportunities will
                      be unlimited. Generally, you can be humble only if you feel
                      really good about yourself—and you want to help those around
                      you feel really good about themselves, too. When we see
                      people acting in an abusive, arrogant, or demeaning manner
                      toward others, their behavior almost always is a symptom of
                      their lack of self-esteem. They need to put someone else
                      down to feel good about themselves.

                      This past year I was diagnosed with cancer and faced the
                      possibility that my life would end sooner than I’d planned.
                      Thankfully, it now looks as if I’ll be spared. But the

                      I have a pretty clear idea of how my ideas have generated
                      enormous revenue for companies that have used my research; I
                      know I’ve had a substantial impact. But as I’ve confronted
                      this disease, it’s been interesting to see how unimportant
                      that impact is to me now. I’ve concluded that the metric by
                      which God will assess my life isn’t dollars but the
                      individual people whose lives I’ve touched.

                      I think that’s the way it will work for us all. Don’t worry
                      about the level of individual prominence you have achieved;
                      worry about the individuals you have helped become better
                      people. This is my final recommendation: Think about the
                      metric by which your life will be judged, and make a
                      resolution to live every day so that in the end, your life
                      will be judged a success.
