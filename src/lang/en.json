    "about.about": "Hello! \n My name is Daan and I am a Dutch front-end developer with a focus on React. I am located in The Hague and am always seeking to expand my knowledge of business and technology. \n \n As a developer, I particularly enjoy the process of taking a design from Figma and turning it into a fully functional website. It's always a great feeling to see my work being used by others. \n In my free time I like to play golf with my family, play video games with friends, and occasionally support Feyenoord at the stadium.",
